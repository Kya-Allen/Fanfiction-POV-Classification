Classifying Fanfiction from Archive of Our Own (Ao3) as either First, Second, or Third Person using Statistical/Machine Learning Algorithms
## Current Content:
  * Notebook on Data Gathering and cleaning
  * Notebook on Feature Engineering
  * Notebook on training ML models
      * Logistic Regression: 86% Accuracy

## Planned Directions:
  * Implement more models:
    * Random Forest
    * Boosting
  * Productionize model for a browser extention for Ao3 users
  * Investigate Features that might allow the model to differentiate between Third Person Subtypes (i.e. Limited, Omniscient)
