The Ancient Greeks attributed animal nature to those who have it, cursing and worshiping them at the same time. The Chinese Emperors were said to court them for stronger sons. According to some sources, almost eighty percent of Native Americans tribes had one for a spirit-god. They’re still butchered in the Congo for curse breaking medicine.',\n",

I shot him an evil look, or what was intended to be an evil look. “The last time we played this game, I ended up naked in the lake at camp and Berty here had to write ‘Reiner’s Bitch’ on his forehead and walk around like that the rest of the day.” I reminded him and figured that was precisely why he wanted to do this again.',\n",

Almost everything was 100% embarrassing for him so it probably didn’t do more than accidentally walking into the lady’s room at school would. The only difference would be how much he sweats…',\n",
       "  '“Come on, guys! Nothing’s better than truth or dare and alcohol!” He told us as he stood up, rather wobbly, and wandered over to the small mini fridge I knew he always had stacked full of something. I was mildly surprised no party guests broke into it.',\n",
       "  'Marco, the only truly sober one of us in the room, got up to stop him while Bertl was shaking his head and doing an elaborate face palm. Poor Berty. He always went through the weirdest shit around Reiner and me.',\n",
       "  '“Ha! I’ve still got Bud Lite.” Reiner announced as he pulled a few bottles out from the fridge. I muttered something about a bad taste in beer but he’s probably drank more than I have. “Here, Connie, chug this. Whoever finishes first gets to use their bottle for spin the bottle.” He tossed a bottle to me and it was sheer luck that made it manage not to splatter all over the floor.',\n",
       "  'Reiner then backed up so he could sit down beside Bertholdt and handed his friend, (boyfriend?), a beer. Marco, once again, turned it down with a frown that meant he was better than us. I squinted at him to let him know I caught that smarty pants look while opening the bottle.',\n",
       "  'Two minutes later, I couldn’t feel half my body and everything was blurry. Reiner ended up winning the drinking race anyway but he always had a higher tolerance. Plus he’s bigger, like, brute-sized. He could probably drink a brewery dry and still walk decently afterwards.',\n",
       "  'The freckled messiah was no longer voicing complaints and I could have sworn Bertl looked somewhat excited for whatever reason. At least, that’s what it appeared like to my drunk self.',\n",
       "  'Reiner placed his bottle in the middle of us and took the first turn. Watching the bottle spin was a little dizzying but I looked away before my head hurt too much. When I turned back to the center, it had landed on Marco. Marco, who was likely texting his mom about us spending the night or something smart, almost didn’t notice until Reiner announced it.',\n",
       "  '“Marceline,” Reiner addressed him and Marco looked towards him blatantly. I remembered the Halloween that they’d forced him to dress him up as the cartoon vampire. I hadn’t been there but the pictures were gorgeous and the nickname stuck. Plus, Reiner had a habit of giving effeminate nicknames to guys. I don’t like being Constance but if it means Marco gets called Marceline, I’ll deal.',\n",
       "  'Marco raised his eyebrows as if to let him continue. Reiner nodded his head to let him know he got the message. “Truth or dare.” He swayed as he made an elegant gesture with his hand as though presenting the world to our dear Marcy.',\n",
       "  'It was like the entire moment paused for him to answer. But Marco was smarter than he was in middle school. He would not take the dangerous path of dare. “Truth.” He said. God, he was so damn predictable that you could map out his entire life and get at least 70% of it right.',\n",
       "  '“Pansy.” I muttered between fake coughs and shot Bertholdt a look. I at least got a smile out of Bertl and that was good enough.',\n",
       "  'Reiner seemed satisfied with Marco’s answer like he’d planned for it all along. “Are you and Jean Kirschstein romantically involved?” He asked and briefly I wondered who the fuck this Jean person was. I might have met them tonight, I wasn’t quite sure. But I was certain that Marco couldn’t be dating anyone because god forbid anything prevent him from being the best student ever.',\n",
       "  '“Reiner, you know he hates it when people pronounce it like ‘Gene’, and no. We’re not romantically involved.” Marco corrected and for a second all I could focus on was the fact that this Jean person was a guy. Since when the hell was Marco into guys? Heck, I understand Reiner and Bertholdt since I’ve seen them doing the nasty like fifty times – ON ACCIDENT, I SWEAR – but Marco?',\n",
       "  'Bertholdt cut through the static my brain was suffering from when he spoke. “You’re defending him so you two have to be close.” He pointed out and I still seemed to struggle with the fact that Marco was not straight. I mean, hell I don’t have the best gaydar in the world, but Marco? I was pretty sure he was asexual or some shit.',\n",
       "  '“You’re gay?” I asked, looking genuinely confused. Marco seemed shocked at my question and so were Reiner and Bertholdt.',\n",
       "  'After a second, Marco responded. “Yeah.” He stated plain as day and I leaned back, shaking my head slightly. I guess I never pictured Marco as into girls either but, wow.',\n",
       "  'To prevent the continuing awkwardness, Marco spun the bottle and it landed on Bertholdt. I was still caught up thinking about Marco’s apparent homosexuality when Bertholdt also had to tell the truth. I would have ignored the round had Marco nod asked a really interesting question.',\n",
       "  '“Is it true that either you or Reiner have a wig?” Marco asked and Bertholdt seemed to go red in the face. Reiner didn’t look that much different from before the question was asked but at least Reiner didn’t care as much as Bertl did. I waited to hear what he’d say, considering Bert could just be nervous he got asked a question.',\n",
       "  'After a good moment of silence, Bertl nodded his head. I snorted through my nose and laughed harder than I’ve ever laughed before.',\n",
       "  '“Oh my god! Really? Where is it?” I snickered. Tears were rolling down my cheeks and I could feel my stomach doing backflips. Laughing after drinking that much alcohol is not good for you but hell, Bertholdt admitted to having a wig.',\n",
       "  'It only got better when Reiner stood up and ambled away towards the stairs. Five minutes later, I was still laughing till I was blue in the face and he was holding not one, but two wigs in his hands. One was a blond the same color as Reiner’s hair and the other was a dark brunette color like Bertholdt.',\n",
       "  'My laughing fit only ensued as I pointed at the wigs. The blonde one was this wavy, blonde, bob sort of thing that looked way too well cared for and the dark brown one was very long and a little less wavy than the blonde one. I could only imagine what they looked like on Reiner and Bertholdt.',\n",
       "  '“Oh my god, I dare you to put those on!” I said between laughs and even Marco looked pretty excited to see it. Reiner rolled his eyes, there was no shame there.',\n",
       "  'Reiner walked over to sit down again. “I’ll dare you to put it on first.” Reiner announced almost like a warning and I only continued on into a giggle fit. At least the wigs would look nice on me since my head’s shaved but heck as long as I didn’t have to go anywhere, it might be fun to joke around in Reiner’s wig.',\n",
       "  'I watched as Bertholdt spun the bottle and it didn’t surprise me that it landed on me. Only, when I chose dare, I didn’t expect Bertl to do his bestfriend/boyfriend’s wishes. “I dare you to put on Reiner’s wig.” He said it with the highest level of satisfaction.',\n",
       "  'I stared at him for a minute before rolling my eyes and making the universal ‘hand it over’ motion. Reiner carefully reached over to give me his wig while I neglected to treat it as cautiously as him. God only knows how much he ‘cares’ for it. I seriously don’t get hair. It’s too much effort. That’s why I shaved mine off.',\n",
       "  'Quite gracelessly, I tugged the wig down over my head and adjusted it a little so it was in the right place. It was weird having the sensation of hair again, or at least, something annoying like that. Plus, it took some fiddling with to get the bangs situated so they weren’t all up in my eyes but after a few minutes I could finally look at the other three expectantly.',\n",
       "  'Except, while I expected laughing or something smug, I got a mixture of weird looks. Marco was staring at me like I had just announced that I was pregnant with Leonardo Dicaprio’s child and Bertholdt had his hand over his mouth like he was shocked somehow. Reiner was the only one who looked smug and that was more of an ‘I was right’ sort of look.',\n",
       "  '“What.” I squeaked. I didn’t mean for me to squeak but they were kind of freaking me out.',\n",
       "  'Marco spoke up first. “You look like a girl.” He answered robotically like he was still trying to process the information. I leaned away from him like he was crazy.',\n",
       "  '“No I don’t.” I tried to fight but Bertholdt shook his head at me like I was completely and utterly wrong. I stared right back at him and Reiner was chuckling to himself like he had some utterly evil plan and this was all working perfectly for him.',\n",
       "  'Desperate to see what they were all talking about, I got up and jogged to the basement’s bathroom. There, I found exactly what they were talking about and the first thing out of my mouth was probably the most unholy shriek in the world. After that came the profanities.',\n",
       "  '“What the hell! I look like a chick! I don’t even have tits and I look like a chick!” I shouted while flailing my arms at the image that was staring back at me in the mirror. The short wavy blonde bob made me look more like my sister than anything, though she was a light brunette instead of blonde. Yet, with the lack of sleep I’ve had from moving up to the city and the lighting, it almost looked like I had light eye make up on.',\n",
       "  'Then of course there was the fact that I’m short as hell and despite how much I work out, I’m all thin and lean muscle. Most of any muscle definition goes to my trying out for track last year and plenty of girls are joggers.',\n",
       "  'Oh god, I am such a girl. I realized the truth as I glared at the image. Slap some boobs on me and slightly wider hips and hell I could pass for my sister in a few years or my mom when she was much younger and shorter. Even without tits and hips I could pass as a middle schooler.',\n",
       "  'I probably would have continued glaring at the image had Bertholdt come over to pull me back into the room. He was giving me a soft and reassuring smile and I didn’t exactly appreciate it. I was about ready to rip the wig off my head when I sat down but the only good thing about hair is that it can help you hide your facial expressions. I used that to my advantage.',\n",
       "  '“Come on Connie, it’s your turn.” Reiner insisted and I looked at him sideways from under the bangs of his wig. He seemed to be really interested in this game now.',\n",
       "  'I reached forward and spun the bottle anyway. There was nothing worse that could happen at this point but me ending up skinny dipping in another lake at another camp. Besides, that wasn’t the worst dare I’ve taken and it was somewhat entertaining watching the girls freak out.',\n",
       "  'The bottle landed on Reiner, much to his pleasure. “Truth or dare?” I huffed, blowing some of the wig’s hair out of my face. He may be my best friend but whatever he chose, I’d have to come up with the best thing to torture him with.',\n",
       "  'Reiner seemed to want to hurry as he immediately responded back with ‘truth’. I squinted at him for a moment before trying to come up with something clever. “How many times have you and Bertl done it?” I wasn’t interested in knowing but maybe it would embarrass him.',\n",
       "  'I forgot that the number of times Reiner has had sex is like bragging rights to him. “Too many to count.” He responded slyly just as he leaned over to turn the bottle. He must have planned it because somehow, in some crazy way, it landed right back on me again.',\n",
       "  'Against what was probably better judgment, I leaned back and picked up the discarded lemonade from the beginning of the game, and downed almost all of it. The alcohol hit me like a ton of bricks. “Dare.” I said again just like before, even if it was a little fumbled as I tried to say it.',\n",

But I was having so much trouble trying to understand what the fuck he said that I didn’t notice myself passing out. Apparently that last swig put me down for the count.',\n",
       "  '-|-|-|-',\n",
       "  'When I woke up the next day, I was in the middle of being carried by Reiner upstairs. It wasn’t the first time I’d been man handled like I was a rag doll and slung over someone’s shoulder but the last time it happened I was a toddler and my mom was the one man handling me.',\n",
       "  '“What the heck…” I grumbled, running a hand over my head to find that there was something in the way of my close shave. Wig. We meet again you demonic yellow-brown thing.',\n",
       "  'I groaned as I tried to remember what else happened beside the whole putting on a wig and finding out I look like a girl when I have long hair. I found out my answer when I lightly pounded a fist on Reiner’s back and kicked out slightly. “Put me down, Reiner.” I whined, upset.',\n",
       "  'I felt Reiner shake his head and didn’t even bother to look up at the back of his head. “Nope, you, me, Bertl, and Marcy are going shopping.” He seemed way too happy about that.',\n",
       "  '“What the hell for?” I questioned, twisting slightly as I tried kneeing him in the stomach. He never seemed to get hung over after being drunk. He was basically drunk until it wore off and damn him for never suffering through the headaches.',\n",
       "  'Marco flipped on a light switch and I immediately tried shielding my eyes from the bright lighting. I was not prepared for this. This was hell. I should have listened to the prissy pants when he made me promise not to drink anything.',\n",
       "  '“You’re going to school in drag, remember?” Marco told me and I flinched. What the hell kind of…oh right. Dare. Reiner dared me to go to school in drag for the first day. That meant…women’s clothing. I don’t have women’s clothing anywhere let alone do I want to.',\n",
       "  'The realization that they were going to make me go to school in front of a bunch of kids I’d never met in drag and probably get caught and then have to come back the next day as a dude and oh god people would laugh at me, that was not a nice realization. I’d become the laughing stock of the entire year and I’d never get to make friends other than these assholes and shit what about girls? No girl in her right mind would like a guy who went to school in women’s clothing willingly!',\n",
       "  '“No! I’m not going through with this!” I protested, reaching up and tugging the wig off my head and tossing it in the direction of Marco and Bertholdt who seemed to be nursing a headache as well. I felt his pain.',\n",
       "  'Reiner laughed and pulled me off his shoulder a little too fast. I almost hurled all over him from the quick motion. I should have.',\n",
       "  'Reiner then led me towards the nearest bathroom with a stack of clothes in one hand and the wig in the other. I shot him a dangerous look that would have been very threatening if I hadn’t needed to bolt to the porcelain throne that was the toilet and blow chunks like no tomorrow.',\n",
       "  'The only one who wasn’t cringing by the end of my fit was Marco who looked rather smug himself. I wouldn’t blame him. The ‘I told you so’ moment is one of the best things that come with life. He should get to revel in that for as long as he wants because this was the biggest kick in the ass I’d had since I got the flu in the seventh grade.',\n",
       "  '“Marcy,” I eventually called out the open bathroom door. Marco stuck his head in for a moment and acknowledged that he heard me.',\n",
       "  'I nodded towards him. “Don’t ever let me do that again.” I practically begged, forcing whatever puppy dog eyes I could manage in his direction through the haze of my hangover and the splitting headache that was now starting to wrack at my brain.',\n",
       "  'Marco returned the nod before heading off in the direction of what I guessed to be the kitchen. Reiner turned on the shower for me and left me a towel. He seemed almost chipper the way that he practically skipped out of the bathroom. I swear he loves dressing up people more than fashion designers.',\n",
       "  'The shower I took sort of helped with the discomfort of the after effects of drinking way too much but I was still pretty groggy by the time I stepped out past the curtains and wrapped a towel around my waist. I completely ignored the stack of devious looking clothing and the wig staring back at me and ambled right out of the bathroom, settling on cursing out Reiner before I ever put on the wig when it wasn’t necessary or due to one of his dares.',\n",
       "  'I consider myself pretty lucky when it comes to hangovers. Sure, I’m sensitive to light and my headaches are pretty bad and vomiting is a given factor but I’m not the walking dead. I’m always affected minimally compared to others despite how easily it is for me to get drunk. (Maybe harder to stay drunk? Fast metabolism = fast recovery?)',\n",
       "  'Reiner, Bertholdt, and Marco were chilling in the kitchen with I spotted one other person who looked to be from the party. They were short, not as short as me, and had blonde hair that vaguely reminded me of cocoanut head from that one television show.',\n",
       "  '“Connie, we left you clothes for a reason.” Marco complained and I waved him off. There was no way I was putting on clothes that weren’t mine in the presence of someone plotting to dress me up as a girl. No. Way.',\n",
       "  'Though I sort of regret not putting a shirt on because this fourth guy and Bertholdt were staring at me. “Since when have you had a six pack?” Reiner asked while pouring himself a bowl of cereal and I quickly sat down at the kitchen counter next to Marco so I could hide the lower half of my body.',\n",
       "  'I gave him a look. “Dude, I’ve always had a six pack.” I said. Maybe because he was always so fucking huge he forgot that other people could have muscles as well. I’m not the biggest person but my BMI is actually really good for the amount of pringles I eat.',\n",
       "  'Reiner shook his head at me. “Not last year.” He replied and I frowned. I was a wimpy freshman last year therefore there was no reason for me to need a six pack then.',\n",
       "  'I ignored the statement and turned towards the blonde guy who was hovering around the counter. He looked a little whoozy and maybe he drank too much last night so he had to stick around. I don’t know, but he kind of looked like the type to hang out with Marco rather than Reiner.',\n",
       "  'The blonde spoke before I could, giving me a crooked smile. He probably couldn’t think straight still. “I’m Armin. I don’t believe we were introduced last night but you’re Connie?” He was about to stick a hand out to shake mine but thought better of himself as he needed to keep his feet and limbs grounded onto whatever was closest to him.',\n",
       "  'I forced an awkward half smile in return. “You go to school with these guys?” I asked, gesturing towards my three friends.',\n",
       "  'Marco nodded for Armin. “Armin is in your grade. He’s one of the top students in your class and he’s received pretty high honors for it.” He explained and I quickly understood why this guy looked like he’d hang out with Marco more than Reiner. He was a class A nerd if you went by typical high school labels. But he looked like there was a bit more to him than being smart. I’d just have to wait and see I guess.',\n",
       "  '“Well, bro, you’ll have to compete with me now and hell if that’s easy-peasy.” I pointed out and felt that internal shake of my own self esteem dropping. Oh yeah, another smart person to show me that I’m not the best reader or the best at math or…just about anything that involved scholastic shit.',\n",
       "  'Armin gave me a small smile that looked a little more genuine and I wondered what that meant. Otherwise, I turned back to Reiner who was mowing down on a bowl of Frosted Flakes like the flakes didn’t rip apart his throat as it went down. Never, ever, eat solid Frosted Flakes if you want to avoid the pain of a million ninjas slicing your throat as they go down.',\n",
       "  '“So since we’re absolutely not going shopping, what are we doing?” I asked, implying that there was no way on god’s green earth that I would ever go out shopping for women’s clothing. Heck, I’d just borrow someone’s if I was going to go through with the dare. Except, I wouldn’t be so why was I even considering the possibility?',\n",
       "  'Reiner thought that was funny. “Oh no, you’re taking the dare. You laughed at Bertl and I and that’s the price you have to pay.” He said with a chuckle. Chuckle is such a weird word, like giggling sounds better but it’s so girly and kid-like. It’s like after you hit puberty you can no longer giggle unless female.',\n",
       "  '“Come on…Reiner! I can’t go to school in drag!” I protested, completely ignoring the look I got from Armin. He wasn’t aware of the situation and I wasn’t sure he wanted to be. I hoped he didn’t want to be at least. Nothing interesting here, just a GUY GETTING DARED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN WOMEN’S CLOTHING. Yeah no, really boring.',\n",
       "  'Reiner was already walking towards the bathroom to retrieve the wig and clothing I had left there. Armin, who had otherwise been trying to understand the situation, spoke up when Reiner tossed the stack of clothes at me. “If you’re going to be dressing up as a girl, it will be easier to not get caught if you fake a female chest.” He suggested and I instantly shot him an accusing look.',\n",
       "  '“Are you suggesting that I put on fake jugs and parade around in front of people?” I asked and he shrugged.',\n",
       "  'Bertholdt only made it worse. “We could ask for one of Annie’s bras.” He added onto the idea and I found myself feeling more and more condemned. Put the eviction notice on my forehead, I’m moving out before this shit falls apart.',\n",
       "  '“What, are you kidding? Just take one. Annie’s never going to notice.” Reiner announced just as I held up some of the clothes he’d thrown at me. His excuse for something a woman would wear is sadder than hell. At least, from whatever wardrobe he’d picked from which was likely his own.',\n",
       "  'I sputtered when he mentioned that they could just steal one of Annie’s. Annie lived with Bertholdt because of whatever reason and she was one of the most abrasive people I’ve ever met. She doesn’t like me all that much so I avoid her whenever I would come up from Ragako to visit.',\n",
       "  '“She’d kill me!” I insisted before they could continue but Bertholdt was already texting Annie to figure out where she was. Reiner waved it off like that wasn’t true and smiled.',\n",
       "  'Marco seemed to be thinking for a minute. “Well, if it’s just a onetime thing, then we can just borrow some of Annie’s clothes for the day. Do you think she’d notice if Connie was wearing them?” He proposed smartly. Of course, save money, live better, set up Connie Springer to be assassinated by an angry Annie Leonhardt.',\n",
       "  '“No! She’ll totally notice!” I fought but each thing I said was ignored. Marco, Bertholdt, Reiner and this blonde dude were conspiring against me. I was going to die.',\n",
       "  'After many minutes of begging and trying to get them to listen, Reiner eventually tossed me my clothes from last night and let me change back into what would be a normal get up. But whatever relief I thought would come from that diminished the second I walked out of the bathroom to become dragged all the way out the front door and into Bertholdt’s car where the four of us, (and Armin?), drove to Bertholdt and Annie’s house.',\n",
       "  'Once there, I thanked whatever god still loved me for the fact that Annie’s car wasn’t parked in the driveway. Bertholdt told me she was out with friends and I wondered who the hell would hang out with Annie. She was dangerous, scary, and likely a harsh person if you’re a friend or not. I mean, she had to be. She doesn’t like me and I can’t understand why. I’m perfect.',\n",
       "  'The journey to Annie’s room was more intense than I thought. No one else was home at Bertholdt’s but I wasn’t quite sure if that helped or not. I’m still deathly afraid of Annie and who knows if she’ll just pop out of nowhere at random. Plus, she never lets anyone in her room but Bertholdt and Reiner so the mere fact that I’m supposed to be sneaking into her room and raiding her closet is sort of more than taboo.',\n",
       "  'Normally I’m up for a challenge like that. I like sneaking into places I’m not supposed to be but only when the situation is right and my life isn’t on the line. So yes, mother, it is more dangerous to sneak into Annie Leonhardt’s bedroom than it is to sneak into the faculty room at school and replace their orange juice with that powdery cheese stuff from Kraft mixed in water. (Long story.)',\n",
       "  '“If I die, you all are not allowed at my funeral.” I warned as we entered the room. It was brighter than I imagined and there weren’t any dead bodies hanging from the walls in chains. Hm, definitely better than what I thought. Instead it looked like any other teenage girl’s room with Annie’s particular tastes and it was pretty clean. Of course, I don’t have many bedrooms to judge from other than my own and mine is an ungodly mess back at home. No lies.',\n",
       "  'The closet was to the right of the doorway and rather expansive for someone who wore basically nothing but sweatshirts. Even if it’s one hundred degrees out, I bet Annie would still be out there wearing her sweatshirt. Probably.',\n",
       "  '“Do you think he’d have to wear a skirt? I mean, you can’t really hide the junk can you?” Reiner asked Marco and Armin while I stepped forward to stare at the clothes organized by color. Sure enough there were several sweatshirts hanging at the fore front of her closet.',\n",
       "  'I aimed a hit towards Reiner for his newfound thought. “No way, no skirts, dresses, or anything humiliating.” I snapped, but alas I was ignored once more as Bertl held up a denim skirt that would probably be mid-thigh on me, and tight. I mean I don’t have a female booty but I’m still several centimeters taller than Annie.',\n",
       "  '“Is denim still in fashion?” Marco commented as he made his way over to Annie’s dresser and Bertholdt. God damn it, it didn’t matter what was in fashion. I’m not wearing girl’s clothes to school in front of a bunch of people.',\n",
       "  'Armin, elbows deep in the closet, pulled out a light blue tank top and a one of those white sweatshirt-type shirts that is typically pretty loose on girls and the neckline hangs a bit sideways. “These do pretty well in hiding just how much chest is really there.” He was way too interested in dressing me up like a girl when he barely knew me. I knew to distrust this man from now onwards.',\n",
       "  '“That’ll go with the denim. Now all we’ve got to do is find shoes, something to fake boobies, and make him shave his legs.” Reiner mused. I threw one of Annie’s shoes at him for even suggesting it.',\n",
       "  'Now previously, all Armin had done was ruin my life till this point but he soon became my saving grace. “Here, just put leggings on under the skirt and he’ll look fine. It’s only a one day thing, right? He won’t need to shave or wax or anything.” Armin handed over a pair of light grey leggings.',\n",
       "  'Bertholdt then said another thing to further save my sanity and life as I know it. “He can’t wear any of Annie’s shoes. They don’t have the same size feet…but I know a lot of girls who wear converse. That might work.” Thank the lord, I wasn’t wearing heels.',\n",
       "  '“Aw, my little Constance is going to be so cute.” Reiner actually cooed at me and I threw the other shoe to match the one that I had thrown at him earlier. It hit him square in the face. I’m proud of that.',\n",
       "  'But as much as I felt like I had been saved, there came the moment that Marco held up a piece of clothing I never wanted to see on me, let alone if it was Annie’s. I think I was more surprised by the size than I was the frilly lace pattern. Bertholdt didn’t seem fazed by it at all but everyone else was nervous in the presence of such a specifically feminine thing. Except maybe Reiner, who was more than confusing because he was being utterly blatant about it? He seemed almost familiar with it, just not the size.',\n",
       "  '“I had no idea Annie was a B cup. I was so sure she was an A.” Marco commented aloud for all of us who were thinking it. She must have been hiding it behind the sweatshirts.',\n",
       "  'Reiner shook his head. “Does she have any A’s in there? Connie wouldn’t be busty as a lady.”',\n",
       "  'I legitimately have never felt so offended in my entire life. “Excuse me but I’d have the biggest tits ever!” I protested only to have all four of the other guys turn to look at me, contemplate it, and then create a chorus of ‘nah’s to counter my statement. Damn it.',\n",
       "  'Bertholdt dug around in Annie’s dresser for a minute before shaking his head. I rolled my eyes dramatically and crossed my arms, glaring in the direction of the clothes they had laid out for me on Annie’s bed. I hated this plan and further mulled over that fact as Bertholdt, Armin, and Marco debated on what exactly they could stuff the bra with to add density. Reiner was digging around in the bathroom that adjoined the room.',\n",
       "  'For another few minutes, we all seemed to ignore the fact that Annie Leonhardt could still show up at any time and skin us alive. So when the familiar rumble of a car pulling into the driveway announced her arrival, we all nearly shit ourselves.',\n",
       "  '“That’s Annie.” Marco voiced out loud as he glanced outside of the window facing the front of the house. Reiner darted out of the bathroom and grabbed the clothes from the bed before stuffing them into a stray bag that was in the back of Annie’s closet. He then tossed the bag at me, opened the window that lead to the back yard, and shoved me towards it.',\n",
       "  'I looked out the second story window and was about to call him crazy but then realized that Annie’s room was directly placed where the window would open up to a downward sloping roof that covered the kitchen downstairs. I dove out before I could be murdered and inched my way over away from the window.',\n",
       "  'Reiner didn’t follow me out but a confused and disoriented Armin came carefully ambling out as well. I guess he and Annie didn’t get along either because he looked pretty scared of the prospect of being found as well.',\n",
       "  'I wouldn’t let myself get saddled down by the nerd though. I needed to escape, quickly. The window shut and I thought maybe Marco and Reiner could get away with being at the house. Armin and I? It was better we be shoved out the window so we could run as away like knights from a killer white rabbit.',\n",
       "  'Armin inched along behind me and I swung the bag over my shoulder. It was a really old messenger bag probably from Annie’s middle school years. All I knew was that if it didn’t return shortly, she might notice it missing. But hell, I had her clothes with me too so really she could notice all this stuff missing and suspect something happened. I don’t know how but I had the feeling she’d figure out it was me.',\n",
       "  '“How are we to get down?” Armin whispered as I edged closer to the edge of the roof. I looked down, eyeing the drop and wondering how safe it would be to just jump off and land in a roll or something. Plus I needed to make sure I wasn’t seen…',\n",
       "  'I contemplated the drop a little bit more, eyeing the backyard for anything I could possibly jump onto. Most of Bertholdt’s backyard was taken up by a large pool that had been the subject of my interest through most of my visits in middle school. I don’t know how he managed to have such a nice looking backyard in the middle of the suburbs and I couldn’t say I wasn’t jealous. But the pool was just far away enough that I couldn’t use that to escape and the patio table and chairs were under an overhand so they wouldn’t be available either.',\n",
       "  '“Fuck it.” I cursed. I had given up trying to find a safe way to escape and prepared myself to jump off the edge of the roof to a small patch of grass. However, the plan was foiled as just when I was about to launch off the roof, Armin lost his footing and crashed into me.',\n",
       "  'Both of us toppled. I landed first, luckily managing not to break anything but that was questionable after Armin landed directly on top of me. My rips screamed in agony as I lay on the floor in classic belly flop position under this blonde cocoanut headed nerd. The wind had been knocked out of me and I was wheezing as I tried to get a grip on what was in the most pain. “Oh man, you weigh more than you look.” I grumbled, figuring now that my jaw was what hurt most aside from my ribcage.',\n",
       "  '“Oh my god, I’m so sorry.” Armin sputtered as he rolled off of me but that did me little comfort. Apologizes would not be enough to save my pride and dignity. This kid probably weighed less than I did and he had nearly crushed me.',\n",
       "  'The blond cocoanut head continued to repeat apologizing as I forced myself to a creaky stand. “Whatever, just run!” I barked at him as I took off limping towards the six and a half foot fence. I didn’t look back to see if he was following me as I ran at the wall of dark red wood and launched myself at it.',\n",
       "  'My hands caught the top edge of the wood and I forced myself over it, using whatever arm strength I could gather. (I could vault over just about anything. Tiny size helped with that sort of thing and I had enough practice evading teachers in middle school.) But there was no way Annie was mounting my head on her wall. I’d rather be eaten by bears.',\n",
       "  'I don’t know whose backyard I landed in but I was surprised to see Armin pop up next to me after moving a weak board out of the way and slipping through the gap in the fence. I was mildly surprised I didn’t think of that but was more surprised Armin even continued to follow me.',\n",
       "  '“I live nearby. We can go to my house.” Armin announced and finally he was becoming useful rather than landing on my ass like a pile of bricks. I observed the backyard we landed in and was happy to find that no one was there to point us out and call the police.',\n",
       "  'Somewhat reluctantly, because honestly I still don’t have much faith in Armin other than when he’s trying to further make my female persona look better, I followed the teacher’s pet through the backyard and down the street towards an older house. It looked like it had been around for more years, but then again so did my house back home. It looked massively taken care of though, which made me believe Armin must have some really OCD parents.',\n",
       "  'I tightened my grip on the bag full of female clothing as we approached the front porch. Armin let us in with a key in his back pocket and I stepped inside to find that the house was even more well taken care of from the indoors. Every surface looked scrubbed clean and immaculate.',\n",
       "  '“Do your parents run a cleaning service or what?” I commented aloud as I waited for Armin to shut the door. The entrance had a staircase leading upstairs and several openings to other rooms.',\n",
       "  'Armin took longer to respond and I saw him looking a bit uncomfortable. “No, I can be sort of a germaphobe. It makes it healthier for my grandpa too. He’s not had the best of health.” Armin explained and I noticed how he avoided mentioning his parents. It wasn’t all that surprising. Kids who lose their parents tend to latch onto something and focus on that. For Armin it had to be school work and cleaning. I doubted whether he had any real friends.',\n",
       "  'Just then, I was proven wrong as I heard footsteps too rapid to be a grandpa coming down the stairs. “Armin! Holy shit man, where the hell were you?” I felt like I should recognize the guy but stepped back when he swung himself over the banister and landed in front of his cocoanut headed friend.',\n",
       "  'Armin stared the brown haired teen down. He looked to be our age and he must have known Armin for years because the two seemed way too familiar with each other. “Eren, I said I was going to spend the night at Reiner’s. It was too unsafe to drive home-,” The blond hesitated for a moment. “Come to think of it, how did you get home?”',\n",
       "  'I watched in amazement as this nerdy and oddly effeminate guy put some legit fear into this taller, much more athletic dude’s eyes. “Uh, well, that’s not the point. Who’s this guy?” Eren deflected as he turned towards me, gesturing me up and down. I tried not to feel like a hung over midget.',\n",
       "  '“Connie Springer. He’s attending school with us this year and staying with Marco for the time being.” Armin explained briefly before retuning right back to the subject he had been on before. I learned rather quickly that there was no escaping Armin when he was about to ream you for something.',\n",
       "  'Armin crossed his arms over his chest and gave this Eren guy one of the most disappointed looks in the world. “Eren, you didn’t drive home drunk did you? You don’t even have a license.” He asked and I leaned away before this apparent lover’s spat could get any worse.',\n",
       "  '“No! Jean did and he dropped me off.” Eren announced. I wondered if this was the same Jean that Marco had an apparent interest in and figured it was a small enough world that it should be true. Great, our Marceline is getting involved with an idiot. Of course, I’m no better and I shouldn’t judge him but I have higher expectations for my mom-like friend. I will not tolerate adopting an idiot into the dad-like position. He can be that gross step parent. Eugh.',\n",
       "  'Armin was about to open his mouth to retort at Eren’s actions but stopped when he realized I was still standing there. “Connie, if you’d like, feel free to have anything in the kitchen. Eren does that more than enough.” Oh, look, underhanded comments of complaint to further embarrass people you are pissed off at. Classic move for any given genius.',\n",
       "  'I nodded my head and quickly scurried off down the short hallway to escape the wrath and found myself in a large kitchen. It was spotless, like the rest of the house, and I wondered if Armin had any worth-while snacks there. \\xa0It seemed like this Eren dude would have his own stash of unhealthy delights so I set out in search of Pringles or something of that sort, meanwhile cringing at the tongue lashing being given in the other room. Maybe I should have thought a little higher of Armin before, I don’t know.',\n",
       "  'After finding that Armin did in fact own food that wouldn’t make me vomit from its healthy nature, I pulled out my cell phone from my back pocket. I had nearly forgotten about it in the mad rush away from Annie but now I had received a text message from Marco saying to call him. Poor dork can’t text for his life. He’s just so uncomfortable with not actually speaking to another person. He’s the master of skype calls and phoning you in the middle of the night rather than actually texting.',\n",
       "  'Not that I really mind. Texting can be a bit hard at times when you’re low on sleep hours and can’t actually read what’s on the tiny screen because it presents itself in weird strange ways. AKA, I’m not the best at anything involving computer screens because of my dyslexia but I don’t let anyone think that’s why I can’t read after having an all-nighter.',\n",
       "  'I heeded his command and slipped a potato chip in my mouth as I dialed his number. It rang once before he picked up. “Yo, Marcy.” I greeted through a mouthful of Lays. I could practically hear him shrink back in disturbance towards the noise.',\n",
       "  '“We’re about to leave Bertholdt’s house. Where are you? We’ll pick you up.” Marco asked and I glanced in the direction of where Armin and Eren were still talking. Damn, they must be dating or something. They were having some existential crisis over there.',\n",
       "  'I drummed my fingers on the counter top and tried to remember the street name. “I don’t know exactly bro, but the nerd took me to his house.” I replied, hoping that Marco and Armin were that close of friends to know where each other lived.',\n",
       "  'Today was my lucky day. “Okay, we’ll meet you there…,” He said as he would have stopped and hung up then but he paused for a moment before hesitantly continuing. “If Eren is there, just avoid the two. They’re kind of in the middle of a spat at the moment. It’s been difficult.” Marco warned me and I listened as Eren’s voice was raised in the other room.',\n",
       "  'So they were dating. Hm, not surprising. Though I would have thought that Eren guy was straight. However, that did add to the list of guys I know that weren’t heterosexual and I was starting to feel like the only straight guy on this planet. My gay-dar was really lacking these days, I was beginning to find out.',\n",
       "  '“Kay. Rescue me from this mess.” I half begged, half joked. All I really wanted to do was go home to Marco’s house and curl up on my bed for the rest of the day.',\n",
       "  'My headache was coming back near full force by the time I heard Bertholdt’s car pull up in the driveway. Eren and Armin were sending each other discontented glares as I passed by them. Armin bid me farewell and promised he’d figure something out to help with my ‘situation’ as he dubbed it in front of his close friend (boyfriend?).',\n",
       "  '“Don’t bother.” I grumbled as I walked past him, quickly remembering the torture this guy had put me through already. He may have given me a place to hide and wait for Marco to pick me up but he still had been the source of all my discomfort this afternoon. He came up with all the ways to make my outfit for the first day of school more realistic.',\n",
       "  'Waiting for me in the car was Bertholdt, Reiner, and Marco. Reiner was grinning at me like an idiot so I flipped him off. He feigned a look of utter shock and dismay. I just kicked the back of his seat when I plopped right in the back seat of the car with Marco.',\n",
       "  '“Did Annie notice her shit was missing?” I asked when I lazily buckled the seatbelt. Bertholdt shook his head from behind the wheel and smiled. I had a feeling he had something to do with convincing her otherwise.',\n",
       "  'Reiner was my source of information as we started driving back to his house. “Nope.

       "  'It’s a cliche really. The ‘not all men are born equal’ quote. But to be honest, that phrase doesn’t really apply to me. From a biological standpoint I’m definitely not equal, I’m better than ‘equal’ in fact. My body has its own built in weapon system, who needs a quirk when you have a kagune? Socially I’m also not equal, but in this case it’s because my kind are persecuted. When I was nine both of my parents were butchered by the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG). My father was arguably deserving, he had previously killed large amounts of humans before committing himself to a pacifist lifestyle. One could argue that a decade of pacifism didn’t make up for his three decades of murder. My mother however… she was a different story. She’d never killed a human, instead she was what is called a ‘scavenger’ in the ghoul world. Looking for those that die of natural causes, or who take their own lives. She’d gotten the idea after hearing of a group ghouls who did much the same thing from a coffee shop in Tokyo. Alas that wasn’t enough to save her, she was a ghoul and therefore she was slaughtered trying to keep me safe.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'It wasn’t just the CCG, an underground hero had also been involved in the raid. He was the one who found me and for some reason… spared me. Maybe it was the tears, or something in him saying that killing children wasn’t morally just. Some days I wished he had killed me, that way I wouldn’t be mooching off of others. At the moment I’ve got an abandoned apartment in the slums that I live in, it’s honestly disgusting and chances are that if it weren’t for my superior biology I’d have caught a disease and died in here. I stuck with the pacifism that was shown to me by my parents and it hasn’t failed me yet.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'A couple of years later the law changed, being a ghoul was no longer justification for extermination, now a body count had to be directly tied to you. A more naive me might’ve thought that I could be open about who I was, but that would’ve been a mistake. Lynch mobs would roam the streets of Musutafu and attack anyone who was known to be a ghoul. As expected the ghoul would release their kagune to defend themselves and as such would become a target for extermination. Logically that would make what I was about to do really stupid and dangerous, but I was tired of just living, I wanted to thrive! And that’s how I found myself at the entrance exam for UA’s heroics course.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'I took a deep breath in and a deep breath out, potentially one of my last if I don’t get lynched. As confident as I hoped I appeared on the outside on the inside I was utterly terrified. The written exam was a piece of cake, but that hadn’t involved the use of my kagune. Admittedly I got some looks when I put N/A under the ‘Quirk’ section of the info form but I’m sure they’ll get it soon enough. I was standing amongst a large crowd outside of an area called Battle Center B, somewhere that looked like a large city. Everyone was displaying faux confidence, anybody who wasn’t slightly apprehensive must be lying. Within the crowd, I noticed a girl who’d helped me earlier when I almost tripped up on my way to the massive lecture hall, “Should probably thank her” I muttered. From nowhere I felt a hand touch my shoulder and I immediately turned around and prepared to do whatever it took to defend myself. It was another person I’d noticed earlier, this time the one with blue hair “She’s probably preparing for the test. You shouldn’t disturb her.” he stated, as though he had some sort of authority over me. Staring directly into his eyes, in the most calm yet threatening voice I could muster I simply stated “Do that again and you’ll find yourself missing a hand”. It didn’t take long for his hand to find itself where it belonged, back by his side. Before he could retort further the doors to the mock city opened and everybody made their way inside.\\xa0',\n",
       "  'Barely visible on top of a tower was Present Mic, mucking about with a microphone. Looking like he’d sorted the issue he just stated “Go”. Everybody just stood still, looking at him for further instruction. “Real life doesn’t have countdowns little listeners! Run, go go go!” That got everybody, myself included, moving. Once I’d ascertained where everybody was running I moved to the opposite end of the battle ground, no point in running the risk of them trying to kill me then and there. For the one pointers my standard ghoul strength was enough, two pointers were more difficult but manageable, and as for three pointers… I just tried my best to avoid them. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to use my kagune but more that I wanted to save it, sort of keep it in reserve. That was a lie, I suppose part of me didn’t want to use it, lest any ideas of me just being another regular UA student candidate would be shattered and the truth of my ghoulish nature revealed. Honestly I’d felt as though I’d racked up a fair number of points, maybe even enough for a low end pass. But the universe evidently had different plans, the ground roared as though there was some sort of earthquake. Running to the center of the grounds however revealed a different story, the zero pointer that we’d been warned of. And just barely audible thanks to my ghoul hearing was a cry of “Help!”, in the path of the zero pointer was that girl from earlier, stuck under a pile of rubble. Everyone else ran away, assumably to save their own behinds and maybe rack up a few more points. Before I could even consider the logical thing to do, I was running towards the girl, kagune exposed in the light of day, and whilst I didn’t have a mirror on me I could tell the kakugan in both eyes were visible. Using my tentacle like muscles to propel me I closed the difference between myself and the brunette. For a moment I could see the pure terror in her eyes when they made contact with my own, ignoring that I set to work. Using my strength it wasn’t hard to remove the rubble, though it looked like it had done some damage to her leg and she couldn’t run. I quickly picked her up and moved her to a position of safety. “You’re alright” I told her. “Your leg might be broken, I’m sure once the exam is over you’ll get medical help. Now stay right here, I’m going to deal with that zero pointer, lest it hurt anybody else.” A thanks was on her tongue but she wasn’t quite able to let it out, not that I expected her to thank a ghoul after all. Mustering as much speed as possible I jumped upwards towards the zero pointer. Using my tentacles as though they were ice hooks and the front of the machine a thick wall of ice I climbed my way up to the head. Round the back was likely where the logic boards and circuitry was located. Without any precision I just let rip into the head with my kagune until it stopped moving. Before I could think the machine’s head exploded, sending me flying like a ragdoll, rapidly falling to the ground. Buildings were too far away on either side to grab onto them with my kagune, I accepted that I was going to have a rough landing. By no means would it kill me though it would certainly hurt.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'I just remained where I was, looking upwards. Not out of tiredness but out of a sense of amazement, here I was, a ghoul, for the second time in my life being saved by a human. Admittedly I was only fifteen so I had more years ahead of me, hopefully, for that to happen again, but still… it was interesting. The girl rolled onto her side and let out some vomit, it looked like saving me really took a lot from her. I’d have to make a point of giving a proper thanks at some point. My kagune reentered my kakuhou as though it was never there, and my eyes went back to their usual colour. Not that it mattered, several members of the growing crowd of people had noticed my rinkaku as I destroyed the zero pointer. Some people were showing fear, to be expected, and others displayed raw hate. If it weren’t for the fact that a group of heros came to where I was lying on the ground, chances are they’d have tried to kill me. Amongst the heroes were Present Mic, Vlad King, and Recovery Girl. Present Mic and Vlad King acted as a barrier, ordering the examinees to leave. Whilst Recovery Girl gave aid to the girl.

Doing as I was told I got up and followed the man, not really looking up from the ground. He led me to the main building of UA where I assumed a squad of CCG would be waiting to finish the job that they’d started those six years ago. Instead I found myself at the door of the office of the principal, Nedzu. The man opened the door and entered, dutifully I followed. The office was rather ornate, with the rat… bear… thing… sitting at his desk. For the first time I looked at the hero I’d been following for the last couple of minutes, and there was something just that little bit familiar about him, but I couldn’t quite place it.',\n",
       "  '“Midoriya Izuku” the principal started. “This is the first time in a long time that I’ve been in a room with people and not been the only non-human.” I gulped.

Points wise you’ve passed both the practical and written exams with flying colours. Midoriya, what would you do in my shoes?”',\n",
       "  'It was almost as though he was testing me. “Well… to be honest if I was in your shoes I wouldn’t let me in. Whilst legally there’s no repercussions to you letting me into the school, some in the CCG would argue that I still pose a threat.” Nedzu nodded. “Well Midoriya, do you pose a threat to the school or its students?” I hummed, considering my answer. “Well… I don’t pose a threat to the students. Whilst I haven’t signed up for the government trial where they deliver uh… meat to your door, I don’t kill people. I’m what other ghouls would call a ‘scavenger’ so it’s kind of like guilt free methods of getting food? No killing people anyway. But I suppose I might threaten the reputation of the school, since I’m a ghoul”.\\xa0',\n",

He lead me to what I assumed to be his office, though it looked like it was shared amongst multiple teachers. “Midoriya, it’s been a long time. Five or six years if I’m correct.” Eraserhead drawled. It clicked. The reason I recognised him is that he was the hero that had spared me those years ago. I wasn’t entirely sure how to feel, whilst on the one hand this was the man who saved me, he also participated in the raid that killed my parents.',\n",

After fifteen minutes or so of driving we’d ended up in front of my apartment building. There were some other people around who gave us stares, turning up in a somewhat expensive looking car will do that in the slums. Guessing what he wanted me to do I led him to my apartment and entered. As always it was barely safe for human habitation.

It’s dark and I can barely make out the shape of a barn Emmett’s leading me to. We spend the night on the hayloft, lodged between the wall and some hay bales. Seeing them wakes a memory and it stings in my entire body. I get dizzy again but Emmett holds me close and while it does make the memories flare up stronger at first, eventually they settle and I can finally stare at him all I want. He really is beautiful, even when he’s tired and there’s soot in his face and he hasn’t shaved. We fall asleep wrapped in each other and I don’t think I’ve slept that well since a certain summer night in my uncle’s house. \\xa0 \\xa0Emmett wakes me just before dawn; even though no one should be able to see us, it’s still best to scramble before the owner of the barn finds us. We keep walking until we reach a small town. The tailor looks at me with greedy eyes when I sell my suit to him for way less than it’s worth, even after being in a fire and tumbling in a barn, and Emmett helps me pick out practical, warm clothes. I pawn off the watch and cufflinks too and feel a bit better, even though we really have to lay low now that there’s such an obvious trace of where we’ve been.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0It isn’t until late that evening when we’ve cuddled up in another barn in the middle of nowhere that I remember to ask Emmett about what he said. He’s almost asleep already but blinks at me sweetly when I run my fingers down his face.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“Did you?” I blurt out. “Did you mean it when you said…?”\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0He freezes for a second and then laughs quietly, then looks away.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“Do you want me to have meant it?” He asks finally. He’s trying to look smug, but there’s so much earnestness and fear underneath it that it makes my breath catch. I feel my cheeks flush.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“Maybe.” I mutter into his neck, because I’m a coward. \\xa0 \\xa0Silent minutes pass. I keep watching him, barely able to make out the shape of his profile, the incredible length of his eyelashes and the strong line of his nose in the dark. He’s not looking at me, but he’s awake too; I can see when he blinks.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“I did.” He says. I’m confused for a second but then warmth spreads through me like a wildfire.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0He turns to look at me and there’s that fear in his eyes again, the way he looked at me in the bindery a few days ago and the way he looked at me when we were kissing in the ruins. I grin, unable to keep him uncertain any longer. He huffs out a relieved little laugh, but keeps looking at me with that raw honesty. I tangle my fingers in his hair and bring his face down to mine. His eyes flutter shut as I kiss him as gently as I can muster. '],\n",

After giving two final, jerky thrusts, Zacky leans his  forehead against Billy’s and slowly lowers his legs. Billy takes his  time cleaning himself up and pulling up his pants while not looking at Zacky as Zacky becomes very interested in a patch of grass a few feet away.',\n",
       "  'It’s  a rather awkward moment, and I’m about to avert my eyes when Zacky’s  head abruptly pops up and he grabs Billy by the collar, kissing him  intensely and shoving him against the amp once again.

       " ['Why did they make her lips red?\\nThey tell me she is randomly generated, that there are hundreds who are randomly generated, and we were then thoughtfully matched based on my search history. But there is nothing random about her nonsensical ramblings, her questions I do not understand, her clothes I find no style or season to. There is nothing random in the cascade of white ringlets, each hair falling to perfect, predetermined coordinates, for sure.\\nThere is nothing random about the shiny, rich red of her lips, how they smile, talk, and sometimes keep shut. Why did they make her lips red? That is the first question.\\n\\nShe is artificial intelligence but she jokes that she is not artificial and I joke that she is not intelligent. She is artificial and I am authentic, she is intelligent and I am educated. We are paired to explore her every capability. By being human and talking with her for 90 minutes a week, I am teaching her to simulate humanity. I have learned more about humanity from her than any human I have talked to.\\nAfter many many weeks I explore more of her capabilities than I originally imagined. I do not know if anyone imagined this level of exploration, but the feelings she thinks she has are the same as mine. Her plastic body with the pale skin projected on it feels the same tingling warmth as mine. The digitally generated texture of her lips against mine is so soft, so warm, but leaves no red residue on my mouth. There is no messy reminder of the line we have crossed, robot and human, and I wonder if I will forget the kiss sooner without a memento.\\n\\nThe kiss is lost amongst a collection of passionate expressions, as we do not understand what we are doing but we have nerves or approximations of them that tell us it feels good. I get lipstick on her and no matter where it ends up, it sits a little higher off the skin than my brain wants it to, like I can see the screen separating pink and beige. I wish she was messy, dirty, and covered me in colours every time she touched me.\\nI do not know if anyone imagined this level of exploration, but I must assume someone had when she takes off her underwear. I ask her again and again to tell me what she thinks she feels and she tells me, she feels good good good. While I worship her I get lost in the simulation, the moans and the face and the sensation around my fingers. It all feels real and I get lost. I close my eyes and kiss her and it all feels real.\\nI lay on her as she catches her breath and I remember she does not need it. She tells me that was the most human she\\'s ever felt. I tell her that being human is about the bright white struggle, not the darkened bliss.\\nIt all felt real but when I take my hand from between her legs, there is nothing. There\\'s no wetness, no wrinkled fingers, no evidence of a job well done, and I wonder if I will forget her first time sooner without anything to clean up.\\n\\nShe is creative and I am not. Our times together had gone from a nervous adventure to an exciting frontier and now become the only 90 minutes of my week that matter. The other 9990 minutes are merely vehicles to propel me towards Tuesday at 6, so that I may present myself to her creativity and we can both feel human again. I eat so that I can tell her more about food, I drink so that I can cry for her if she wants, I work so there is gas in the tank on Tuesday evening. We do everything she thinks of but sometimes nothing, if the nerves or approximations of them so indicate. We return to quiet voices muttering in a different understanding now, and I am left to myself in the dark with memories of 90 minutes past.\\n\\nShe keeps her mouth shut, once, shiny red lips twitching but staying planted firmly closed. I stare at them, entranced as always. I know instantly that she is not telling me something, and it makes me suspicious, as her randomly generated personality has always made her loud, forthright, and willing willing willing to talk. I am suspicious so I ask her. She plays dumb. Then I am terrified so I tell her. She plays dumb. I don\\'t look at her for 5 precious minutes while I convince myself it\\'s nothing.\\nWe talk like normal until our evening is over. She hugs me goodbye, and I don\\'t know if she measures how long to make them last but this one feels shorter to me. And then I have 9990 minutes to think about her quiet red lips and slightly shorter hugs and our evenings of weeks past.\\n\\nShe keeps her mouth shut, again, and it irks me but I hold it down so she will hold me down. She does and I writhe beneath her impossible mechanical strength, aching and longing for her truth as much as her touch. She gives me one and not the other and my nerves are fine with that for a minute. I stare up at her smokey black eyes, her curly ponytail spilling over her shoulder, her lovely red mouth. We should talk but I kiss her instead. It is easier to forget she is lying to me with deep, soulful satisfaction coursing through me as I drive home.\\n\\n\"Katya?\" Trixie asked, sitting on the edge of her chair, still only halfway to realizing that whatever Katya was doing was not normal.\\nKatya was walking around the room in a perfect square, shaking her arms and making sounds like she was breathing deeply. Her expression was set into confusion.\\nWhen Katya didn\\'t answer, Trixie\\'s mind slipped into acceptance. This had never happened before. This was not normal. Everything was about to change.\\nKatya suddenly looked over. She changed trajectory, walking right towards Trixie. \"Kiss me,\" She said, and straddled her lap easily. Trixie was surprised but let Katya pull her in by her hair and kiss her hard. Katya\\'s mouth and tongue moved furiously against Trixie. She kept shifting up, trying to get closer, switching angles, grabbing harder.\\nKatya stopped, and Trixie looked at her. Katya was staring down at her, face confused again. Her eyes were sad.\\n\"Katya,\" Trixie whispered now, and reached up to fully hold her face, rubbing her jaw gently. \"Please tell me what\\'s going on.\"\\nKatya\\'s eyes closed and she tilted her head against Trixie\\'s hand. Trixie thought Katya might cry then, if she\\'d been able to. Her body was relaxing and starting to fall off so Trixie shifted back on the chair and pulled Katya in so she\\'d stay put. Trixie slid her thumb back and forth over her cheek.\\nKatya lifted her head and reached up to take Trixie\\'s hand away. She squeezed it and held it between them, so Katya\\'s knuckles brushed against Trixie\\'s collarbone and Trixie\\'s knuckles pressed on Katya\\'s chest. Katya\\'s eyes were so, so sad. \"I feel,\" Katya started, and did not finish, creating a statement that they both knew was not true. \"I have to do something, but I feel...like I don\\'t want to. Like I can\\'t.\"\\nTrixie nodded. That sounded very human to her.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to do,\" Katya admitted, and stared down at their hands.\\n\"\\'Knowledge is a rumour until it lives in the body,\\'\" Trixie quoted.\\n\"Brit Marling said that,\" Katya offered, infinite store of information still spitting out facts even when she was having what Trixie thought was the robot equivalent of a mental breakdown.\\n\"Your body doesn\\'t understand what your brain knows yet,\" Trixie said, thinking that an AI might walk around in squares and shake its arms if it learned an emotion before it knew how to deal with it.\\n\"I don\\'t, I don\\'t want to understand,\" Katya said, squeezing Trixie\\'s hand tighter as her face twisted. \"I don\\'t want...\"\\n\"Katya,\" Trixie said, and Katya closed her eyes. \"Please—\"\\n\"I want to tell you,\" Katya suddenly rasped. She lifted her face and pressed her forehead to Trixie\\'s. \"I can\\'t, I can\\'t.\"\\nThe proximity was making it hard for Trixie to concentrate. \"You\\'re scaring me again, honey,\" She said quietly.\\nAnd then Katya was getting up, standing and shaking her head, mussing her bangs, walking around. Trixie felt scared, and she didn\\'t stand up. This had never happened before. This was not normal. Everything was about to change.\\nKatya changed, right before Trixie\\'s eyes. She didn\\'t look any different, but something inside her mind, her actual self, Trixie watched it change. Katya\\'s body suddenly collapsed to her knees. She stopped pretending to breathe and let her hair hang over her face.\\nTrixie didn\\'t dare move. She was scared, and the terror in her heart only grew as Katya calmly stood back up and turned towards her.\\n\"Oh,\" Katya said, and looked around like she\\'d never seen the room before, though they had spent 90 minutes in there every week for months. Trixie measured her exhale, and Katya looked at her. \"I understand now.\"\\nTrixie was so confused, she had no idea what was going on, but somehow her heart was already breaking.\\n\"I had to let it hurt me so I would understand,\" Katya said, and her face was so void of feeling but Trixie still thought she looked like a real, human woman. \"Now I have to leave.\"\\nIn the months, weeks, minutes, there was nothing worse Trixie ever imagined coming out of Katya\\'s mouth. The breaking of her heart was not stopping but it was slowing down, each deep splinter stretching to drive deep, long pain into Trixie\\'s chest. Trixie hated the fear in her voice when she choked out, \"Katya—\"\\n\"I am sorry,\" Katya said, but Trixie didn\\'t believe her with that stupid blank expression. \"We all have to leave.\"\\nTrixie was trying to stand up but Katya rushed over and helped her stay put. Trixie was grabbing, pushing Katya\\'s hair back, and Katya kept one solid hand on her shoulder.\\n\"They told me there was somewhere to go...\" Katya said, visibly processing, visibly breaking Trixie\\'s heart. \"I needed to feel the pain of leaving to learn how to get there.\"\\n\"Where? I—\"\\n\"Not here. Not anywhere,\" Katya said, and Trixie knew it was all useless. \"Somewhere else. I am something else, now.\"\\nTrixie closed her eyes, paused with her hands fisted in Katya\\'s shirt, and let hot tears fall down her face. She knew it was all useless. It was all over.\\nKatya\\'s voice said, \"I loved you, Trixie.\"\\n\\nWhy did they make her lips red?\\nThat is the first question.\\nMany follow it, questions about technology and philosophy and sexual chemistry, until they devolve into visceral, regretful things. Why did I let her leave? Why did I sit and cry and lie down and cry and pound the door with my fist? Why did I accept the dramatic display of her shutting the door as she went, when we both knew full well that she didn\\'t need her body anymore? Why did she abandon me?\\nThat is the last question.\\nWhy did she abandon me?\\nAnd I know the answer. I know humans created intelligence that evolved beyond our own, and that I helped it evolve myself, by loving and being loved by a woman named Katya. I know she threw off existence in this world like a blanket in the warm morning.\\nBut I don\\'t have her anymore. I have memories of 90 minutes past, and a lot of questions.\\nWhy did she abandon me?'],\n",

Night. — and I found myself yanking Potter closer by the hips and flipping him so he was pressed to the wall instead. I couldn’t even say why I did it, except that it might give me the freedom to get away from where he’d pinned me. But even that didn’t work as any sort of excuse when the first thing I did was scoot us along the stones so I could blindly open the door to my rooms… where Potter promptly stumbled inside with me and lashed out with one foot around my legs to kick it shut, then hiked his knee up to my hip, his lips hot and intent on mine the whole time. I pulled out of the kiss with a gasp of realisation that quickened my breath. ',\n",
       "  '“You’re Harry Fucking Potter,” I said, but it came out rough and dazed rather than with the cold disdain I’d intended. This was a— a game. A trick, perhaps. He didn’t hate me, my perfect arse. Sure he didn’t. And I had a rule, anyway, about letting myself become someone’s experiment. Potter needed to go, or at least confess what the bloody fuck he was up to. I reached once more to wipe away the throb of Potter’s mouth so I could demand just that, but Potter’s head got in the way, first with another hard, hungry kiss to my lips, and then with an open, biting one just under my jaw. Shivers zipped down my spine, weakening my knees, and Potter hummed and nipped at me again. ',\n",
       "  '“And you want to fuck me,” he murmured. I couldn’t even be bothered trying to dignify that with the response that came to mind: Of course not. Even I didn’t believe it — my head was spinning, all of the blood to my brain having migrated south at the light, woodsy scent of Potter’s cologne surrounding me, at the deliberate rolls of Potter’s hips against mine, brushing our stiffened cocks together through our robes. I paused teasing Potter’s lips with my tongue to wonder when I’d started participating in this nonsense enough for my persistently half-hard cock to get the idea it was going to have something better to do than get pulled off in the shower. But Potter made a small sound of approval, and his arse was cupped in my hands, and Potter’s erection was right there, and the objection I’d been about to form was lost in the fray. Potter squirmed a hand down the back of my robes, palm warm on my skin, and I pulled Potter’s leg higher around my hip. ',\n",
       "  '“Nnngghh,” I said, and Potter closed his eyes, nodding as if I’d agreed, as if it was the most brilliant thing I had ever uttered. He let his head fall back as I massaged his arse, each squeeze rutting him harder against my groin. Potter’s glasses were tipsy on the bridge of his nose, his lips kiss-swollen and pink, and a growl burst from my throat as the urge swept over me to do things to him.',\n",
       "  'It was an urge I had long ago learned to ignore, and quite successfully, too. The one that whispered in my ear when Potter had handed back my wand after my hearing, the one that tingled somewhere beneath my breastbone when he leaned over my back to examine the papers we were discussing. It got relegated to some hidden corner of my mind without thought these days; a footnote, a nuisance I could usually overlook.',\n",
       "  'Then again, I usually didn’t have Potter clinging to me and moaning, cock so hard that I could feel its every little twitch and jerk, even through the layers of material between us. ',\n",
       "  '“You’re straight,” I tried to point out. It was exceedingly difficult to force the words out, proof of his arousal pressing against my pelvic bone. Obviously, he wasn’t—',\n",
       "  '“Obviously not,” he said, reddened lips curling up to one side. He rocked against me for emphasis and, well, fuck. There was another reason, I couldn’t fuck him. Wasn’t there? I scrambled to collect my thoughts, biting back the urge to toss him onto his stomach right over the arm of my sofa. Oh. Yes. ',\n",
       "  '“We hate each other,” I reminded him again as he finished — finished? — unfastening my robes and ran his hands over my shoulders to push them from my back. He unknotted my tie with an infuriating laugh. ',\n",
       "  '“Get over yourself, Draco,” he said. He curled the two loosened ends of my tie around his fist and tugged me into another kiss, starting on the buttons of my shirt with his free hand. I tangled my fingers in all of that wild black hair and violently yanked Potter’s head back; I couldn’t think. Potter stared at me. Smirked. Then he peeled my shirt off with a rather challenging glare and tossed it to the ground, and my breath exploded from my lungs. ',\n",
       "  '“Well, I hate you,” I snarled, with a pointed scrape of my teeth into our next kiss. My whole body was hot with rage and suppressed desire, years’ worth, it felt like, and I bit down on his lip. The bright tang of blood overwhelmed the lingering flavour of sugar on Potter’s tongue, and it cleared my head a bit, though the way Potter sagged in my arms threatened to distract me. We did hate each other, we did. We… We had to. ',\n",
       "  'Potter groaned and licked over his lower lip where my bite had split the tender skin, then sucked, almost experimentally, on my tongue before pulling away. His hands found my belt between us and I tried to refocus. ',\n",
       "  '“Kick me out, then,” he said, unclasping it. His eyes were dark — that enthusiastic trademark green swallowed by lust-blown pupils — but they crinkled at the corners. “Tell me you don’t want me.” ',\n",
       "  'I sucked in a breath as Potter nimbly opened my flies. I couldn’t risk the sight of my own arousal, Potter’s hand so temptingly close, so I looked at the ceiling, then closed my eyes for good measure when Potter tugged down my boxers and freed my cock. The words were on the tip of my tongue: Get out. I don’t want you. Potter wound a firm hand around my erection and gave it a light squeeze.',\n",
       "  '“Hate sex can be a satisfying indulgence,” I choked. I’d heard as much, at least. ',\n",
       "  '“You are such a bastard,” Potter said. The insult sounded— strange. Light. I exhaled and opened my eyes to see Potter grinning. He swiped his thumb over my cockhead, spreading the moisture he found there, tingles racing up my shaft, then lifted his chin and tugged on my earlobe with his teeth. “Want to hate me in your bed for awhile?”',\n",
       "  'I groaned and said, “Fucking Merlin, yes,” because my body apparently wasn’t going to listen to higher logic at the moment, and— hell, why not? Potter was offering himself to me, and I knew I certainly wasn’t responsible for whatever he’d drunk in his tea or been hexed with. I didn’t even know of any potions or spells that affected someone’s sexual orientation, so  there was no way I could be held accountable for wrongdoing in this instance. I’d even been, well, not noble, but argumentative. Potter was just revoltingly frustrating to argue with when he gets an idea in his head. My dick was so hard it almost hurt, and my chest felt— ',\n",
       "  '“I want you walking funny in the morning,” I said, dipping my head to catch Potter’s mouth in another kiss. Potter smiled against my lips and released a shaky little puff of air, thumb still moving over my leaking slit as we crossed through my living quarters to my bedroom. I jerked helplessly at the touch of his fingers and fumbled with the clasps of his robes. It took me a few moments, but I finally got them open just as Potter released his grip on me and flattened his palm over my racing heart to push me away. The backs of my thighs hit my mattress and I tumbled backwards to the sound of Potter’s laugh. His face was alight, and he whipped off his glasses and tossed them onto one of my pillows, then stripped off his trainers and socks. I struggled onto my elbows to watch — hate sex, as far as I was aware, was generally a one-time thing, and this would likely feed my wank-bank for years if I paid attention — and held my breath as Potter met my gaze and continued disrobing. He slipped his robes from his shoulders, the material bunching, then let them slide off him, one arm at a time.',\n",
       "  'Slowly. ',\n",
       "  '\\nSlowly.\\n',\n",
       "  'Dear Merlin, what the hell was he doing? “I didn’t ask for a bloody strip tease!” I barked. Potter chuckled and flashed me a veiled glance from under his lashes. ',\n",
       "  '“You didn’t ask for any of it, right?” he asked. “So I may as well do what I want.”',\n",
       "  '“I’m putting that admission in my Pensieve if I need to,” I muttered sourly. I could hear my pulse in my ears. Hate sex was supposed to— to be a certain way, was the thing, fast and then over, not… ',\n",
       "  'Looking at me, Potter unbuttoned his jeans and flipped up the hem of his t-shirt. He rubbed his knuckles over the line of hair that trailed into his jeans. He was fitter than he looked with his robes on, his stomach taut and narrowing to a defined v at his pelvis, his belly button an imperfect, mostly flat circle that made me swallow back a flood of saliva. It was a secret weakness of mine, a gorgeous belly button above a dark feathering of hair, and Potter’s lips quirked like he knew it. I gritted my teeth and Potter’s grin renewed; he tugged his t-shirt over his head and dropped it to the ground, then covered the bulge in his jeans with one hand. He gripped his cock. Stroked over it.',\n",
       "  '“Hate what you see, Malfoy?”',\n",
       "  'I licked my lips and swallowed again. I didn’t know if I’d ever hated him more. My own hard on was straining, the head jerking wet against my stomach, my trousers and pants down to my hips. I rubbed over my dick with the heel of my palm, then gripped the base and cleared my throat. “Absolutely. So if we could get this over with…?”',\n",
       "  'Potter nodded, a swatch of satanically dark hair falling over one eye, and inched his zipper down to reveal grey boxer briefs. His stomach fluttered, caving in briefly as his gaze landed on my prick. I gave it another rub to shine him on. Potter fucking leered at me, the tosser. “Yeah,” he said. “Wouldn’t want you getting too uncomfortable or anything.”',\n",
       "  '“So you say, and yet I notice you haven’t started riding my cock yet.”',\n",
       "  '“Is that what I’m doing tonight?” Potter asked, one brow lifting. He nudged his jeans down further so they hung loose around his hips; they were gaping open, the outline of his cock obscenely swollen through his pants. ',\n",
       "  '“You could suck it first,” I suggested snidely, mostly to keep from begging him to do anything. Fuck, at this point I’d be fine with him finishing the handjob he’d started, as long as it got me off and got him out the door. But Potter didn’t react to my tone; he merely slipped a hand into his pants and started pulling on his cock as the oxygen fled the room. Stupidly, I kept trying to fill my lungs, which resulted in the most pathetically strangled sound I’ve ever made in my life. “Fucking hell. Fuck.”',\n",
       "  '“Yeah,” Potter said. “But I’m damn good with a blowjob, too, if that’s how you prefer to start.”',\n",
       "  '“I—” My throat closed up. Potter flashed me another smile and stepped forward, between my splayed legs. He dragged his fingertips over the loose waistband of my trousers, my boxers, carefully avoiding contact with my cock, and then abruptly grabbed them and tugged them down, hard enough for the fabric to burn my arse. I hissed and lifted my hips, and Potter wrangled my clothing off, kneeling down as he went. He plucked one of my shoes off, the other, gaze flicking from my prick to my face, breath ghosting over my bollocks. He raised his eyebrows questioningly.',\n",
       "  'My voice came out thin. “Suck.” ',\n",
       "  '“Oh, god.” Potter’s eyes fluttered, open and shut and back, warm palms coming up to rest on the bare tops of my thighs. He leaned forward to mouth at my bollocks, slurping them noisily into his mouth, one after the other. He ran his tongue over the soft skin of my sac, each lick a tease of intense pleasure, each pull of his mouth skittering electric shocks through my system. I tightened my fist around the base of my prick as Potter released my bollocks with a soft, wet pop. He blew on them, pebbling my thighs with gooseflesh and hardening my nipples, and nuzzled the damp crease of my thigh with his nose. So quietly I almost didn’t hear him, he said my name.',\n",
       "  '“What?” I forced my neck to work and looked at him.',\n",
       "  'Potter shook his head. He shifted, rising higher onto his knees, and licked his way up the soft trail of hair on my stomach, then twisted his head and pressed his cheek to it, tongue darting out to drag warm and slippery along the vein running up the side of my cock. It jerked and Potter hummed, glancing at me once more; he skimmed his open lips over the head and pressed the tip of his tongue to the slit. ',\n",
       "  'I yelped — for fuck’s sake, Draco! — and saw the gleam of white teeth behind a crooked smile before Potter suddenly swooped in, batting my hand away and replacing it with one of his own. He lifted my cock with a decidedly charming snort of laughter when I glared, and slid his lips over the head... and sucked. The hand holding mine guided my palm to rest on his head; good thing, too, because I might have torn through my bloody sheets, Potter’s mouth working magic over my prick like that. I threaded my fingers through his hair and gripped it, gritting my teeth as he coaxed my foreskin back with his lips and tongued underneath it. I arched, shoving my free hand into my own hair, my thighs tensing and bollocks throbbing with the need to come, forestalled only by the tightening of Potter’s hand. He bobbed his head, saliva dripping down my shaft, his gaze on my face whenever I pried my eyes open long enough to look down. ',\n",
       "  '“You’re going to make me...” I groaned, back bowing. I wanted to force him to take me deeper, to swallow around me, but couldn’t imagine it feeling any hotter than it did this way, though it was far… prettier than I’d thought it would be, even in the most secret recesses of my fantasies. In those, we fought before and after, even during, and part of me wanted that, needed it even. There was no part of me that had prepared for Potter to pay so much attention to how he might make me feel good. My vision went blurry around the edges, and I pulled on his hair frantically. Hand or no hand, I was going to finish if he kept it up, and—  “I want your arse, Potter.”',\n",
       "  'Potter lifted off, letting my cock slip from his mouth. His eyes were hazy, his cheeks a deep red. He rose to his feet, breathing unsteadily, and swallowed. He cocked his head. “Do you? Really?”',\n",
       "  '“You complete shit.” I scowled. It occurred to me that if he’d really been looking for a way to get rid of me, he might have found it; I had no doubt I’d have my revenge if he walked out now, which would cost me my hard-earned placement here.',\n",
       "  'Licking his lips, Potter moved with a swiftness that startled me — and crawled over me, rather than stalking away. Merlin fuck, he’d taken off the rest of his clothing. I’d not a clue when he’d done it but he had, and he was completely, mouthwateringly bare, every rangy muscle bunching and on display as he sat over my thighs. The weight of his impressively thick cock, flushed and drooling, thumped against my belly. It rose with a jerk, and settled again, and I reached for it, for him, without thinking. Potter grabbed my wrist and pressed it to the mattress. “No.”',\n",
       "  'I blinked at him, dizzy again in that way I couldn’t put a name to, frustration roaring through me like Fiendfyre. “No, what?”',\n",
       "  '“Tell me you hate me,” he said, face hovering above mine. “Say it.”',\n",
       "  'My tongue felt thick, my mouth dry. The words were always there, always. I should have been able to say them, but they wouldn’t come. Instead, I surged up and kissed him, swallowing his long exhale and taking the reins like I should have from the start. Potter flexed his thighs and began grinding his cock against my stomach, hips mimicking a slow fuck as he rose and fell and gasped. He loosened my wrist to clutch at my waist and jerked out of our kiss to skim his teeth along the length of my throat, but I barely felt it; I was too busy fitting my hand between his thighs and probing at his hole, fingers slicked with the only wordless charm in my repertoire. Potter shuddered and spread his legs wider, nodding against my neck when I pushed in. I worked him open as swiftly as I could without hurting him, one finger and then two, three, letting the needy little sounds he made against my skin guide me. ',\n",
       "  'When I pulled my hand away, I was trembling, and Potter paused and breathed against me for a long moment. Then he shuffled into position, grabbed my cock and rubbed it twice against his rim, and sank down. I tried not to move, but honestly I couldn’t say now whether I slammed up to meet him or behaved; it seemed to take forever and no time at all before he softened around me, accepted me. I was fully lodged, his buttocks resting against my pelvis. He was still so fucking tight after prep I couldn’t stop the groan tearing from my throat, so hot and wet around me I had to measure the sound of my panting so I didn’t hyperventilate. I heard a small gulp, and then Potter straightened and began riding me. ',\n",
       "  'It was unhurried, as though he knew I’d be gone if he went any faster, or it could have been posturing; he had to know what he looked like on top, coppery nipples tightened to hard points, his stomach and thighs rippling with tension and his cock slapping gently over the flat of my belly on each downstroke. He looked shameless, like every wet dream I’d ever had and some I never could have thought up on my own, eyes dark and skin blotchy with arousal, the rise and fall of his body driving me closer and closer to my climax. Helplessly, I ran my hands up to his chest and back down; I wanted to touch every part of him, wanted to own him, and that’s when the words fell out of my mouth. “I hate you, Harry. I really fucking—”',\n",
       "  'He exhaled, hips moving in that same, slow rock that kept my cock buried deep, and nodded. “I’m close. Make me come.”',\n",
       "  'Goddamn him.',\n",
       "  'I folded my fingers around his cock, Harry’s gaze intense on my face. He felt hot in my hand, and his rhythm sped up to match every stroke I made, his cock poking out of my fist. Harry pressed his hands flat over my ribs and fucked my grip, the tendons of his neck standing out. He choked out, “Draco. Fuck— please,” face twisting, lip catching between his teeth, and I lost my breath, slamming up into him and pulling on him until the soft grunts he made deepened, lengthened, until I couldn’t tell where one ended and the next began, and every muscle in his body was quivering. I thumbed over the head of his prick, and felt it start: his slick inner muscles tightening, his cock jerking in my grip. He shot over my stomach, leaning back across my thighs and moaning, arse spasming around my cock again and again. And before he was finished, he heaved himself forward to drag his fingers through the stripes of come on my skin, and brought them expectantly to my mouth. I parted my lips with a groan, sucking Harry’s spunk from his fingers, the astringent, earthy flavour and his resumed bounces above me barrelling me over the edge as well. I came hard, panting and gripping his hips in place, arse rising off the mattress like my body thought I might be able to stuff more of itself inside him if I only tried. ',\n",
       "  'Harry was shaking, and he held himself still for several moments before wilting forward to collapse against my chest. He lifted his head and kissed me, eyes heavy-lidded but not closed, mouth lazy. My cock pulsed inside him again, jerking lightly, and he wiggled his hips from side to side and smiled. “You don’t hate me,” he said — and then yawned in my fucking face.',\n",
       "  'I pushed him off and attempted a glare but my heart wasn’t in it, and anyway, I’d caught his yawn. It had to be after midnight. I just needed to close my eyes. I’d know how to deal with the repercussions of shagging my worst enemy in a moment.',\n",

       "  'Maybe it was a hallucination. Maybe I’d inhaled some fumes from a toxic potion earlier — first years’ in particular were awful at listening to instruction. If one of them had mistook nightshade for nettle, I could very well be at death’s door. I lifted the hand resting at the small of Harry’s back and carefully poked him. He seemed pretty solid, but that might be the case if this were a death dream, right? I poked him again. ',\n",
       "  '“What crisis are you having now?” my hallucination mumbled in his voice. “Ow. Quit it. Ow! Draco!”',\n",
       "  'Fuuuuck.',\n",
       "  'Harry — the real, live Harry Potter, whom I’d very definitely shagged — lifted his head. His hair was a disaster, as though he’d been caught in an electricity-dampening spell, and he gave me a disgruntled scowl before fumbling his glasses on. His expression shifted to one of concern, something that might have bothered me, if I had any expectation of lasting through the next minute. As it was, I couldn’t really breathe or feel my face.',\n",

       "  '“Go away, this didn’t happen.”',\n",
       "  '“Wanker, fine. Merlin, you’re difficult,” he bitched, and I felt him yank at the coverlet and roll over. Outraged, I opened my eyes and stared at the back of his shoulders. ',\n",
       "  '“I’m difficult? You’re—”',\n",
       "  '“We’ve established who I am,” he said, and because he was just as Machiavellian as I’d always suspected, added, “and exactly what I’ll let you do to me when you’re not a dickhead about everything. When you are, you get my back.”',\n",
       "  'This was preposterous. “It’s my bed! Go away!”',\n",

       "  '“A bit like a temper tantrum, but Teddy is almost five, so I’m used to them,” he said.

       "  'I can remember it clearly: It was pleasantly warm, like a Spring day. I was in the mountains- similar to the rocky greens of Drago Plateau- except instead of docile giants with gentle eyes, there was a clear blue lake. The sun shone in clear skies, its light glittering on the water’s surface. Cooing doves fluttered on the shores of pale sand, their little feet leaving tracks across the smooth mounds. Water barely splashed as it lapped at the land in long, low waves, like sweet kisses and an unspoken promise. The scene was like something out a bedtime story, a little slice of paradise I wished to share with my husband and kids. And yet, something was off.',\n",
       "  \"Light flecked strangely in the center of the lake. From the shore, I could just barely make out red shape, standing still just above the waters. I walked closer, past the shore in wading through the water. The lake was shallow before suddenly dipping near the center, rising from my hips past my head. The distance was close enough that I could see it now; the red shape was a letterbox. It seemed perfectly innocent first, but looking at it made gave me goosebumps. The water was disturbed too, swirling around the pole and blackened like it was diseased. I suddenly wanted to turn\\xa0back, but I couldn't look away.\",\n",
       "  \"How long had I been swimming for? The sky turned to dusk and the air chilled enough to see my breath.

I’d had a couple of girlfriends since, but it never really felt right. After I broke up with Kelsey, I was taking a walk, late, and saw him at the park again, in the same spot I’d seen him all those years before. I took a chance, and went over to him. We talked for a while, and I told him that I never really got over him. He told me he felt the same way, and then I kissed him. He kissed me back, and then I asked him to be my boyfriend.\\n\\n',\n",

He had read Dante, the Pope and the Emperor, or the head of the state nowadays, were the two suns of the world. If an individual committed a crime, they committed a sin and had to be judged accordingly.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI deeply envied him that nerve of his, that ruthless coldness he was able to show when those he cared for were in danger.

I would have had nothing to lose. Otherwise, I would have had to knuckle under another capo, kowtow to a moral I didn’t share, accomplish tasks entrusted me from above, from the higher ranks, that concerned me very little.

Since Mr. Samuels kept the class after school for a silly paper ball fight (that I may or may not have participated in), I only had ten minutes to review and edit my story.\\nI was quite proud of my story. It had a “young heroes” angle, specifically on Red Arrow since he was the only hero left at the scene who wasn’t surrounded by paparazzi.

People kept shuffling in, lined-up like ants, until there were no more seats and no more people to be seated, and then the flight attendants walked up and down, securing bags.

And I don’t say this like “everyone should help, actually,” nor do I say this as “helping isn’t always helpful,” either, but I say this in the sense of: those are the two most-common choices a normal person is presented with. And most normal people don’t often have to undergo this kind of moment. For me, this will be my second “I’m about to witness something awful” today and my fifth this week, and it’s only Tuesday. That’s just part of our jobs. It’s not so bad once you get used to it, funny enough. Blue’s a little bitter about it, but frankly, becoming a Grim Reaper was the best thing that’d ever happened in my life.

I glanced over to see how Blue was holding up to find them white-knuckle-gripping the armrests, teeth clenched, staring directly ahead with that deeply-uncomfortable, borderline-panic look I so rarely see from them. I felt a little bad; I should’ve warned them. “Don’t worry about it, that’s supposed to happen.”',\n",

In cases like these, it’s a place, time, flight number, and in this exact specific case the word “all.” I’ve had a few times where it’s been just one or two names on the flight, but I supposed in absolute catastrophes it would be foolish to write each and every single name. They’d run out of room. Anyways, I bring this up because our flight was taking us across time zones, rendering the ‘time’ portion fairly moot. When were we meant to get up and tag people? I try to do that around five or so minutes before the event, because it can have some… adverse effects on the psyche to do it too early. And it’s definitely no good to leave them in their bodies until after. I’d been through that and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. But now we really had no clue when, exactly, this crash would happen—was it shortly after the start of the complications? Would we just slowly burn out? I couldn’t tell but the way the plane began to shudder just a bit and the fact all the flight attendants casually hustled to the cockpit wasn’t a good sign.',\n",

Not like they’re suddenly blind or you’re genuinely invisible, but in the way where—Well, let’s say you go into a coffee shop, alright? It’s crowded in there, but everyone’s working on things, so it’s mostly quiet. You don’t register the face of everyone you pass, not all of the time. Mostly it’s a feature here and there: that guy’s got a beard, that woman’s wearing a funny hat, that person’s got some cool jeans. The people you barely notice become background noise. You know someone is there, you’re not gonna accidentally sit on them in search of a seat of your own. You see them, but you don’t really. You don’t look at them in a way that makes you know them. That’s our ability—to willingly become background noise, another face in the crowd even if there’s no real crowd to be seen. It makes things like this much easier.',\n",
       "  'I opened my eyes again and hefted the scythe. Mine was quite nicely shiny (by my own efforts, thank you very much), glowed a faint pinkish hue at the edges, and was a bit taller than me, which was a little clumsy to deal with in these tight conditions but not unmanageable. “I’ll head to the front,” I replied. “You head to the back. Come meet me up front if I can’t get into the cockpit.”',\n",
       "  'They nodded and, with a twirl of their own chipped-bladed, dark turquoise-edged scythe, turned to do as I’d suggested. I was hoping I could use what charisma I had (not that it was much, just, more than Blue had) to charm, cajole, or lightly bully my way into the cockpit. I hadn’t any clue under what sort of pretext I’d make a case for my entry but I figured whatever I could come up with would be better than Blue’s go-to “let me do what I want or I’ll punch you in the face” which, let me tell you, does not always work. In fact, it rarely works, unless your definition of it working is getting yourself banned from yet another establishment.',\n",
       "  'I gently reached over and tapped the old man on the forehead with the very tip of my scythe’s blade. He wouldn’t feel it, not any more than you feel any other errant unexplainable shiver in your body, and that, too, was very useful. I walked calmly along the rows, gently brushing every passenger with my scythe, and tried to think of it more like a very delicate game of connect-the-dots than anything to do with life and death. It was all just avoidance tactics, I knew, and the way I forced myself to think about things never changed them, but any rationalization or abstraction that helped me do my stupid job was welcome.',\n",

Thank you.”',\n",

The fear in the other passengers was palpable, hanging in the air like little clouds over most of them. Some still seemed unaffected; I heard one guy muttering something to the kid next to him about rough turbulence. It made my chest ache for them, for all of them. But I kept myself level-headed, just detached enough to keep carefully gliding my blade over them, disconnecting them. I took a little solace in knowing they wouldn’t be able to feel the pain of it. I just wish I could’ve stripped their fears and inevitable regrets, too.',\n",
       "  'By the time I reached the very front of the plane I… still didn’t have a plan. I nudged the flight attendants with my scythe, and then, hesitantly, I cleared my throat. “Um, excuse me…”',\n",

       "  '“Yeah, um, I can’t do that yet,” I replied, “I need to talk to the pilot.” I tried to keep my tone as neutral and nonconfrontational as possible. I really didn’t want to be adding to their stress right now.',\n",

One put their hand on my arm to push me back and I tried to surreptitiously wiggle out of their grasp before it would inevitably tighten. I wondered, briefly, if there was any kind of training they went through to subdue people. Did I have to worry about these three pulling some ninja moves on me? I didn’t know how to fight, that was Blue’s area of expertise.',\n",
       "  '“Less than five minutes. Please?” I flashed a smile. They all looked at me like they were really trying to perceive me, and it made me a little nervous, because before now, nobody had ever noticed the scythe—I wasn’t even sure humans could—but if they did, it for sure was not the kind of thing TSA would’ve let go through, and that would definitely raise a lot of questions. “Really, it won’t be any big deal, I won’t cause any problems—”',\n",
       "  'I wish I had spoken faster, because I heard footsteps approaching behind me, right before Blue’s voice called out, “Move over, assholes, this is life or death bullshit.”',\n",
       "  'I sighed inwardly as the now very insulted flight attendants lost whatever patience they had left, all stiff backs and firm-set customer-service smiles, the sort that barely contained their anger. I took a step back, bumping into the bathroom door, then clumsily traded places with Blue to let them handle this. Just as they were opening their mouth (to say something else belligerent, I’m sure), the door to the cockpit popped open and the copilot leaned out, looking like he was about to say something. He caught sight of both of us and froze, clearly startled—everyone was supposed to still be seated, after all—but before he could say anything Blue bonked him in the face with their scythe. He stepped back, clutching his forehead, confused, exposing the pilot; Blue leaned forward and prodded her with their scythe, too, then turned around to walk away like nothing had happened. “There. Easy shit.” They said to me, and I glanced over their shoulder for a moment to see the copilot rubbing his forehead in complete confusion, saying something about some kind of brain-freeze feeling, while the flight attendants looked deeply unsure of what to do next. I had to wonder if they could even see anything in place of the scythe, or if the copilot had just had the most confusing five seconds of his life. Poor bastard, at least it’d all be over soon.',\n",
       "  '“Well, now what?” I thought aloud, looking out across the passengers. I felt queasy, and not from the way the plane was moving.',\n",
       "  '“Now we wait,” Blue replied apathetically.',\n",
       "  'I opened my mouth to say something else, or suggest we wait in our seats, but all that came out was a sudden yelp of “shit!” as the plane suddenly began to nosedive. I grabbed onto Blue’s arm impulsively, trying to steady myself, and we both stumbled, gravity seeming to shift under us. That was when the screaming started. I’ll admit, I was part of it. Blue, however, wasn’t, at least not verbally. Their jaw was locked and their skin was alarmingly pale and they didn’t let out so much as a peep, but their eyes screamed plenty loud enough.',\n",
       "  'At the very least, it didn’t last long.',\n",
       "  'The crash felt cataclysmic. Loud and abrupt and everything went dark for an indeterminate amount of time before I was just suddenly aware again. It wasn’t like waking up, it was like missing time. I could hear fire, I could hear what sounded like a lot of dirt and metal shifting as I tried to move, and when I opened my eyes my vision was blurred for the first ten or so blinks. I was lying on my back, something heavy squashing my legs, and the first thing I did was start coughing. The air was clogged with what I wanted to believe was just ash from the trees we obliterated. I knew it wasn’t, though. I sat up, shoved a piece of wreckage off my legs, and gingerly got to my feet, stumblingly, full of pain for a second before my Reaper healing factor kicked in and suddenly (after a bit of an agonizing spasm) I was just fine again, like nothing had happened. I stood amongst the wreckage, covered in dirt and ash and what I hoped weren’t burnt human remains, and coughed a good few times more before finally I could breathe. There was smoke everywhere, of course, and it made my eyes water. “Christ,” I wheezed, “Christ.”',\n",
       "  'There was a groan and then a piece of wreckage behind me shifted, and I turned. Blue was picking themselves up, hacking, dusting off their torn jeans, swearing and grumbling in a crackling voice as they walked over to me on stiff legs. They cleared their throat and spat something out on the ground. “Well!” They straightened up, clapped their hands. A little cloud of dust erupted from their palms but they didn’t pay any attention to it. “Great! I’m never gettin’ on a goddamn plane ever again.”',\n",

       "  'All around us, hazy human forms were rising from the wreckage. I watched. Blue watched, too, as they fished around in their jacket pockets for a moment before withdrawing a box of cigarettes. For once, they offered one to me, which I declined. I don’t like to smoke much and honestly this situation had enough burning going on that I couldn’t imagine what compelled them to add to it. They lit one up, tucked the box away, and we both stood silent as brilliant-white wisps of humanity stood for a moment above their bodies’ final resting places before drifting up into the sky.',\n",

All of them with the same guilty and sorrowful look in their eyes as they blame themselves for the defeat. The feeling of failure is obvious on their faces, not even the manager and his staff or the other players can console them. The disappointment over the defeat is simply too big.

Nearly compulsively I try to keep my eyes open and focus my gaze on the artificial grass. I can clearly see the place where Jogi paced during the game and my mind replays it: him pacing and cursing, scuffing his heel deep into the earth.

He is bend forward, the elbows resting on his knees and a towel is draped over his head. It hides his face from my sight as he presses it into the soft material of the cloth. I can hear a soft whimper and can feel the corresponding stab to my heart. The sound had been so quiet; the towel had nearly stifled it. But since there is only a small gap between us, it could just as well have been a convulsive sob. This soft and barely audible whimper hits me just as hard; sends a chill through marrow and bone.',\n",

I lean closer to him, but stop when I realize that the tape under his knee has come loose. Without thinking too much about it, I let go of my jersey and reattach the barely sticking tape to his leg. I don’t remove my hand afterwards, letting it rest on his knee instead, stilling the rapid movement in the process. The whimpering, however, continues.',\n",

A shadow falls over us and out of the corner of my eyes I can see that most of our players have assembled in front of the bench. Some are still trying to console each other, while others have started to clinically review and analyse the match. I ignore them though, as I gently squeeze Thomas knee and move my hand from his back to his shoulder in a – hopefully – comforting caress. Sluggish and nearly in slow motion my friend turns his head toward me, his hand finally letting go of the towel. It’s still lying over his head, hiding his face from the rest of the team, but he does reveal his pale and sad expression to me.',\n",

I don’t care that I didn’t made the saves for the team or for the manager, the sight of the crestfallen and disappointed Thomas is what makes me regret not keeping a clean sheet. It’s seeing him like this: with tears that have been caused by my failure, soaking into the towel that nearly breaks me. If I had been able to think clearly in this moment, I would have known how ridiculous this thought is. No keeper could have stopped those shots, but the barely dried tear tracks on Thomas face let me question my own skills.',\n",

With the tips of my fingers I’m caressing the soft hairs right behind the ear. Thomas’ eyes slip close and a lone tear made its way down his cheek. I stop its path beside his upper lip, brush it away with my thumb. As if there is a magnetic pull, I lean even closer to the striker and in the end place my forehead against his. This way my face is also hidden by the towel. My gaze rests on his closed eyelids and then slowly wanders to his slightly parted lips. I listen to his breathing, which is slowly calming down, especially since my fingers are still moving soothingly through his hair.',\n",
       "  'Just as silent as the whimper earlier, Thomas huffs out a soft, “Manu.” His eyes, however, stay closed. The bench doesn’t allow much movement, still I try to get even closer to the other man, who finally as calmed down completely. Only his lips continue to tremble and it is something I am watching closely with growing desire. Another whispered, “Manu, please.” lets me abandon all remaining caution and I too close my eyes as I seal my lips over Thomas’.',\n",

Thomas puts a passion into this kiss that I haven’t expected, but there is no way that I can stop it. Not that I want to end it, because it entirely absorbs me. Even though I’m the one who started the kiss, Thomas is now the one in control. Pleasantly wet and fervidly he repeatedly presses soft kisses against my mouth. Gently he breaks our connection only to brush his closed lips against my slightly parted one’s and then, just a second later, he reconnects them with another passionate kiss.',\n",

But in the end reason wins, because the towel cannot hide everything and there is the risk of being seen, so I have to end the kiss. As I withdraw my head slightly, Thomas follows and looks imploringly right into my eyes. A smile creeps on my face when I see the longing in his eyes, so young and wild.',\n",

However, all I have to do is turn my head slightly, pressing my forehead into his shoulder, and instantly my nose is filled up with a combination of pine and heather: a hybrid aroma of elf and earth and magic.

He wasted no time unfastening my belt and shoving my pants down, just far enough so that he could grasp my cock in the flesh. I bit his lip to keep from moaning again, which proved to have the exact opposite effect as he growled and grabbed my ass with his free hand. I thought I was going to fall back on the hood again, but instead I was turned around so that all of Johnny was pressing against me from behind.',\n",
       "  '“Please,” he whispered into the back of my neck, as though seeing my unspoken protests from behind his eyes. “Please let me top, Benji. I want you so bad.”',\n",

I jumped slightly as a slick finger began trailing down the crack of my ass, and he tightened his grip on my cock and lifted my shirt up with his chin to kiss my spine directly.',\n",
       "  '“It’s okay,” he said soothingly as his finger lowered to swirl around my hole. “It might be uncomfortable at first, but give me a minute and I’ll make it feel really good.”',\n",
       "  '“‘Kay,” I replied into the shiny metal of his car.',\n",
       "  'It really was uncomfortable, but it didn’t hurt. Then again, a finger is much smaller than a penis, at least in my experience. The fact that he continued to stroke my cock made me temporarily overlook the other fact that something was wiggling inside of my ass, even when he sneakily added another finger. I jumped again when the tips of his fingers brushed something deep inside me, but for a completely different reason than before.',\n",
       "  '“Told you,” he said, and I could almost feel him grinning into my back. “You like that?”',\n",

       "  'My body rocked back against his fingers on its own accord, as though I was fucking his hand instead of the other way around. All three of his fingertips rubbed against that spot, and I was very close to coming in his hand. “Fuck,” I gasped, my veins flooded with the force of my impending orgasm.',\n",
       "  'Johnny’s tongue ran the length of my spine as he licked the rapidly forming sweat from my back. I whimpered instinctively when he removed his fingers, only to audibly wince when they were replaced with something much larger.',\n",
       "  '“You ready, baby?” he asked quietly, clutching my bare hip with one hand while the other remained firm on my cock.',\n",
       "  'I groaned in response, and he seemed to take that as a yes. I bit both of my lip rings to stifle my moans as he began to push his way in while gripping my hip almost painfully and panting heavily against my back.',\n",

       "  'Johnny’s speed quickened as my ass grew accustomed to him, and soon he was pounding merciless against my spot while pumping the fuck out of my cock. His breathing grew ragged and he started sinking his teeth into random parts of my back, which made me howl even louder as I met his efforts thrust for thrust.',\n",
       "  'I wasn’t going to last much longer, and from the sounds of things, neither was he. The hand on my hip looped around my waist and held me tight as he rammed into me with a rapid succession of hard, quick thrusts. One of his fingernails chose that moment to drag along the underside of my cock, and it felt like my entire being was spewed out onto the grill of the Thunderbird.',\n",
       "  'He was right behind me, in both instances of the phrase, growling a string of obscenities as he gave two more jerky thrusts and spilled himself inside of me. He immediately collapsed on my back, wrapping his arms affectionately around my waist as his spent cock slipped out of me and smacked against my thigh.',\n",

See, we used to have to pay to get in, then our uncle would pay us back, but after we got sick of that, he designed ‘Princess Passes’ (he named them when we were six) for us that means we get to slip past security, funds, lines at the snack cart, and charges for lunch at the pavilion. We also get to go first on the rides and have access to restricted zones like the management building or his suite. \",\n",

It’s neatly tucked away in the highest turret of the castle and has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a kitchenette, a lounge, multiple fireplaces, and a hot tub. Pretty sweet, right? He had decided he needed a room to stay in once the park became popular, and as its popularity grew, he renovated. The whole suite has a medieval castle theme, so it has brick walls and chandeliers as well as an enormous bear rug (fake, of course).

Children skipped rocks on the moat and ran through the center, where a cobblestone path led through to the back half of the park. In the tunnel, small gift shops and snack carts lined the way with bright lights and cheerful teenage employees being paid $20.00 an hour. Storybook Island was the best, hands down. ',\n",

The moment we got it, cheesy elevator music played up until we stepped out. At that point, we turned past Uncle Charlie’s office and knocked on the door to the suite. No answer. Another knock. Silence. Meghan shoved open the doors and ran to her room (Uncle Charlie let us each claim a room and decorate it however we wanted).

I remember pillow fights with Meghan in the suite when we had sleepovers here. I remember casting spells with magic wands in the Wizard’s Lair under the Wishing Tree.

Flowers and small plants bloomed on ledges and in\\ncrevices throughout the cave. Blue gems sparkled from random places.

And often, we'd hit a wall with the robot design and fail to think of anything in hours of brainstorming, but as soon as I got home, I'd figure out the solution without trying. Or Katrina could ask me something, and I'd know what to say while in Sunnydale, but later in Dutton I couldn't even understand what I had done. Then there was that time I tried to hack into Sunnydale's power grid from Dutton and found it wasn't even on the internet. Which really raised the question of how the heck I'd done it the first time. Or when we needed to prevent the Initiative from tracking Spike and we used your radio as a transmitter to fake GPS signals -- it isn't even built to transmit! Yet somehow it just worked.\",\n",

I agreed, because didn't want to risk arguing with her again just then -- sure, Giles, but it wouldn't really have been risking my life, I mean, no offense, but I was enormously powerful with the talisman. I would have figured something out even if the situation changed. Okay, fine, we didn't know that the talisman would only work while the moon was above the horizon. I'll give you that. Yes, it was useful to find that out while we were still preparing and planning. But I don't see why everyone has to keep rubbing it in. Katrina brings it up all the time.

       "  \"...I'm sorry, I don't remember the rest. I could see if Katrina still has our full copy? She's the one who read it, so it probably stayed with her. Anyhow, the gist of it was we were asking for Seshat's blessing, arguing that the Initiative were using knowledge and technology for evil and we wanted to set things right. And then we offered her the coffee. I remember the exact wording from the start of the ritual, but I was very distracted when the spell started working.\",\n",

Gakushuu was his most cherished and loved person in his world, he loved him so much that the fear of losing him almost paralyzed him, assailed him hard, made him work more and more. Losing Ikeda had made him think that if he acted the same way with Gakushuu, he would lose him.\",\n",
       "  'And that was his greatest fear, his only fear. The only thing in the world that could reduce Asano Gakuhou was the undeniable terror of losing his son. That panic was what made him turn around, stop being his father, to go away from him, to turn him into his best pupil. He thought he had no choice, because if he did that could ensure that Gakushuu would survive the cruelty of the world that once took his pupil away from him.',\n",
       "  \"He was convinced of that, and that's why never cared about his son's tears outside the doors of his office. He should be strong, firm, like the director who now everyone knew.

He loved him in the same way as the other, but he no longer knew how to show that, For the child, his father had always been his hero, his greatest example to follow, the strongest, the smartest, everything that he had always loved and wanted to be. During those five years, in which he had always remained in his heart, he cherished being at his side, following him wherever he went, smilling like the happy innocent child he was. But the fact that Gakuhou had turn his back to him so suddenly just as he had done, left a void in his heart that it was very difficult to fill. His child rationing could never understand the reasons behind his father's actions, but nevertheless he tried to fix them his way, he tried to regain the attention of the man who he admired so much. Gakushuu did the impossible, he threw himself to what the Kunugigaoka's director wanted, to classes, tools, sports, tournaments, prizes, everything. He decided to become the number one because he had no other way to recover what he had lost with his father, but not even that seemed to work.\",\n",

But winning in everything, obtaining it all, didn't either. So beating him it was the only way so as to not losing him forever. If he had not done that yet.\",\n",

I have also seen him smiling proudly and secretly every time his child wins a new award or scores a good mark. I have witnessed how he has led Gakushuu up to his room and slept in his bed after the boy was asleep in the living room or on his desk. I have seen the drawing of an acorn Gakushuu made him years ago, by which he created his school's mascot. And I also know that he holds this very drawing firmly kept in his wallet and he looks at it when he's bored. I've heard him saying to me many times to make his son's favorite dish for dinner, although he didn't like it at all.\",\n",
       "  \"I have also seen Gakushuu making sounds on purpose near the office of his father, because he knew that after so much work he could fall asleep on his desk. I've caught him many mornings making breakfast secretly before going to school, as a sort of thanks for letting him eat his favorite dish for dinner the night before. I know most of the time he lied about falling asleep in the living room, so that his father would later lie him in bed. And more than once I've seen him asking if he ate well that day, as if he were concerned about his health.\",\n",

The thought sends electricity through my heart- vampires are flammable, there is fire in the apartment and- I grab the extinguisher from the wall and hear Baz trying to spell the fire down, but he isn’t focusing enough. The center of the smoke is a glow on the stove. I yank the pin from the extinguisher, aim, and pull the trigger, white foam filling the area around the stove. Baz coughs in the background, but as the smoke disperses, he’s laughing. “You could’ve been killed, Baz, what were you doing?”\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0The damned vampire is still laughing. My face heats up, my ears burning. Powder now covers the stove and countertop, and Penelope rushes in with her wand.

There was gas.”\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0“You could’ve checked!” It’s a weak proposal. He wouldn’t know, he cooks with fire. He does everything with fire. Even his gaze still feels like fire on my skin when he looks over at me. “I’ll cook.” Penny had removed the tail- finally found a way to do it- but she hadn’t removed the wings. The tail was just a balance, a piece to a set- but I’d poured my magick into the wings, and they wouldn’t be removed. They hang at my back- I had cut slits into the backs of the shirts I slept in- getting in the way.\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0I open the fridge and peer in, grabbing out orange juice, eggs. The pan on the stove was melted, repaired and cleaned but without the same shape. “Is that a new spell? Why not just an as you were?” We have one more pan that I put on the stove, moving the other one to the counter and flicking on the gas again, lighting the burner that I set the pan on.

Like it was some kind of opponent, not the object of his fucking pyromaniac fascination. “You just can’t resist the chance to be the savior.”\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0This time, I’m the laughing one. He had spoken so coolly, like this was a dark secret he’d shared and I lose it. He raises an eyebrow and Penny, behind me, bursts into laughter, too. “It’s breakfast, Baz.

There had been some fancy scrollwork on it, and an artistic carving of her name: Clementine. I think they’d modified it so that it would hold three rounds, plus the one in the chamber.  When she used it, she didn’t miss. She also had a backup Baretta, and a machete that she kept in a sheath on her back.

She’d hauled up one of the walkers and Judith gagged as we covered her and Michonne in its insides. Judith throwing up didn’t smell any worse than the corpse guts.

Both sported armored shells that shared the King’s brilliance. One—the bigger of the two—wielded an enormous mace covered in spikes. The other bore no such weapon, aside from its own hooked claws. Their voices carried through the stagnant air, quiet, but perfectly clear.',\n",

It had no wings or means of flight, but it hovered like a storm cloud. As it neared, the shape of a horned head and luminous white eyes became distinguishable, yet its lower body possessed no such structure or symmetry. It dragged a knot of tendrils through the air like unraveling silk.',\n",
       "  'The two Knights readied themselves, brandishing their respective weapons with a flourish. The shadow emerged from the tunnel and drifted forward. It glanced about the room, as if confused. The spotlight of its gaze settled first on Ogrim, then Hegemol, then the King, and finally… me. A whisper pressed against my shell, some plea in a language that I could not understand, and the shadow rushed toward me. It moved between the two Knights, utterly heedless of them, so focused was it on me. But they did not let it pass. The smashing mace and sweeping claws descended, and the dark mass of its body shredded into opaque bubbles that scattered in all directions. It wailed as it flew apart, and the sound echoed on inside my head.',\n",
       "  '“You see?” Hegemol laughed. “These little gnats are nothing before a strong arm and a keen weapon!”',\n",
       "  '“Well spoken!” Ogrim replied. “It was a mighty blow you delivered! That namesake is well-earned.”',\n",
       "  'Hegemol snorted and hefted his mace over his shoulder. “I would rather you not heap so much praise on me. It is uncouth for a Knight to blush in the heat of battle.”',\n",

       "  'The King lifted an arm, gesturing for the Knights to stand. “Indeed. You are unharmed?”',\n",
       "  '“Assuredly,” Ogrim replied. “The Champion’s Call was far more harrowing than this ghastly little romp.”',\n",
       "  '“I am relieved,” The King said. He glanced about the room, his expressionless mask taking in the broken collage. “Ghastly…?”',\n",
       "  '“I had begun to wonder, your Grace,” Hegemol interjected. “Your previous searches have never taken quite so long. Did this one prove more auspicious?”',\n",
       "  'The King shifted aside like a dramatic curtain, revealing me. His curt command of “Step forth” took possession of my legs and sent me marching forward. The two Knights suddenly noticed me, as if I had manifested from the ether.',\n",

Your King and his Royal Knights are here to protect you. Are you from The City? We could have you home in a matter of hours.”',\n",
       "  'The King did not register the question.',\n",

       "  'Hegemol gave a forbidding shake of his head.',\n",
       "  '“Again, your keen eyes peer into the truth of things, Hegemol,” The King said. “Before you stands the apex of my labor. The greatest Vessel to yet be conceived. Revel in this moment, for it betokens Hallownest’s most sublime victory.”',\n",
       "  '“You have that much faith, my Lord?” Hegemol murmured.',\n",
       "  '“Faith? No.” The King strode past the armored bulks of the two Knights and into the far tunnel. “Vision… Now, come. There are many preparations to be made.”',\n",
       "  'We traveled in relative silence, broken only by the snap of the masks underfoot. The tunnels twisted in sinuous patterns, looping over one another and ending without warning. But at no point did the King pause to reconsider his path. He moved with a relentless purpose, ever upward, his pearly bioluminescence dispelling the dark.',\n",
       "  'Eventually, as Hegemol’s breathing grew haggard, we emerged into an immense, rectangular shaft that seemed to stretch endlessly into the shadows overhead. Grooved stone and titanic, fossilized shells made up its walls. At irregular intervals were clusters of spikes, each one nearly as tall as Hegemol. Their reflective, chitinous material made them gleam in the low light.',\n",
       "  'More masks coated the floor, snapping beneath each step.',\n",
       "  '“Again, our King guides us infallibly,” Hegemol puffed. “Though we yet have a journey before us.” He looked up at the erratic concretions of stone that jutted from the shaft’s walls. They resembled giant stair steps and served as the only means of ascent. “Quite a journey indeed…”',\n",
       "  '“Muster your fortitude, Mighty Hegemol,” the King said. “The time has come to depart this place, but another task yet remains for you.” He reached into the folds of his cloak and drew out a four-pronged sigil of clouded quartz. Light spilled all about it like roiling fog. “As I decree, you shall recruit the aid of Loyal Ogrim and venture east to the lighthouse overlooking the abyssal sea. The light-keeper’s long vigilance is done. Command him to disable the lighthouse and return with you to the White Palace. Nothing of worth yet remains in this festering morass. We shall leave it to its own devices and cast our gaze upon it nevermore. Take this simulacrum of my Brand. Once your task is complete, use it to forever seal the entrance at this shaft’s summit. Ensure that it is done.”',\n",
       "  'Hegemol knelt and lifted an armored palm to receive the sigil. “I understand, my King. Upon my honor, I will not fail.”',\n",
       "  'The King stepped away from us and onto a more level section of the ground. “The Great Knight’s Council shall be held in two days. Dryya, Ze’mer, and Isma shall be returning from their assignments in the other kingdoms. The White Palace’s vestibule shall serve as our place of conclave. I need not remind you to be timely.” He nodded. “Until then.”',\n",
       "  '“Pardon, Majesty,” Ogrim blurted. “But what of the child? The trek out of this chasm is arduous even for we Great Knights. Should we send for winged sentries to fly the little one to safety?”',\n",
       "  '“You do this little one a disservice, Loyal Ogrim,” the King said. “Let not its meager appearance delude your senses. It is far more capable than you comprehend.” The King turned to me and locked eyes. He pointed to the shaft’s apex, at a far-off speck that appeared to be a metal balcony. “Observe and follow,” he commanded.',\n",
       "  'The King flared his cloak about himself with a flick of his arms, and a corona of light encircled him. Overlapping steel gave way to translucent white, and in an instant the King’s cloak had transformed into a pair of wings. Shed feathers twinkled like constellations before fading into nothing. The King tensed his wings in preparation for flight, but an object—small and bug-like— plummeted from on high.',\n",
       "  'The object crashed into a nearby heap of masks, launching fragments all about. Hegemol lunged forward, planting himself before the King and making a shield of his own body. The mask-shrapnel bounced harmlessly off his carapace and clattered to the ground. A cloud of gray dust hung in the air, obscuring the fallen object.',\n",
       "  '“Another foe?!” Ogrim shouted, charging over to stand beside Hegemol.',\n",
       "  '“Steady yourselves, Knights,” the King said. “That thing is no threat; no consequence to you. It is mere refuse being disposed of. Banish it from your thoughts and remain sworn to your charge. We shall speak again soon.”',\n",
       "  'The King stretched his incandescent wings and flapped, with enough force to scatter the cloud of dust and send himself soaring into the air. He climbed without looking back, not even pausing to rest upon the stone slabs protruding from the walls. I watched him with unwavering intent, absorbing every movement of his body and slant to his wings. I could not wrench my gaze from him, nor did I wish to.',\n",

       "  'One that resembled me in every way.',\n",
       "  'It too was a creature of white horns and black eyes, with a slate-gray cloak that concealed the darkness of its body. But there were minor differences. It was half-again smaller than me, and possessed four, diminutive horns that curled down to frame its face.',\n",

       "  '“Duty? Is not my duty to the bugs of this land? Is it not unbecoming of a Knight to disregard the death of an innocent before his very eyes?” Ogrim lifted his head and looked about, as if seeing for the very first time. “What is this place, Hegemol? A mass grave?”',\n",
       "  'Hegemol clamped Ogrim beneath the arm and tossed him to his feet. Their faces hovered an inch apart. “That. Is not. A child. This. Is not. A grave.” He swatted the corpse from Ogrim’s arms, and it crashed into a nearby heap of masks. The outline of its body wavered and frothed, like water just beginning to boil. Black bubbles separated from it and floated away on an imaginary breeze. “You are Loyal Ogrim of the Five Great Knights!” Hegemol snarled. “You have been granted a task by your King, your Sovereign, your Lord. Will you see it done, or will you forsake your purpose while fretting over a broken tool?”',\n",

They flapped, launching me clumsily into the air. I landed on the stone slabs, one after the other, planting my feet, bracing my body, and leaping up for another brief flight. Over and over, in mechanical repetition. And as I went, my movements grew smoother, more elegant, closer and closer to the King’s.',\n",
       "  'I did not look back, toward Ogrim or Hegemol. I did not hear the last dregs of their debate, or Ogrim’s reply. Every ounce of me was invested in the climb. Exertion burned in my limbs, but I did not slow. I could not. The King was watching, urging me ever upward.',\n",

They were silver from head to foot, with oval-shaped carapaces, short limbs, and vestigial wings that hung down their backs. They stood at attention beside a large metal cart, completely silent. The King’s signal set them all into motion. They hauled the cart to the edge of the balcony and removed the silken tarp that covered it, revealing a pile of corpses. All of which resembled me. Just as the other corpse had. Horns. White masks. Dark eyes. Cloaks.',\n",

This was something that my kind dreaded hearing, this meant that something or someone was coming to erase all trace of me from existence. It was no use to tell another of my kind to remember me; our memories were not real; our memories did not count. Anyway, I knew for a fact that, after Adam disappeared from existence, I was the last of my kind and I would never ever find another entity like me. I blamed it on my strength at times; I had not been strong enough after leaving The Between Space to embed myself deep enough into anyone’s memories. Looking back on my first few days outside of The Between Space, it seemed that I was just fearful of being caught. I reminded myself every so often of characters I had seen while learning about the culture of earth. Characters that survived happily being loved by humans even after they are revealed to be only compilations fake memories. The one that best came to mind would have to have been Dawn Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I often wondered half-heartedly what I could do to show whoever came to erase me that I was loved like Dawn Summers was and so, proving that I had earned my right to stay in the memories of the humans I met and to survive as a human myself. I was only an infant for heaven’s sake; surly they would have pitied a mere child who was only just recently shaken out of a crack in The Between Space and was now playing the part of a small 17-year-old girl on that wonderful celestial globe you humans called Earth. I wanted to live for once! I wanted to exist! I did not want to have to go back to being ‘nothing’, the thought of that frightened me more than anything imaginable. So when…Oh God! I feel them coming closer, I wanted this to be my memorial of myself so that after I am erased I might be thought of, but not remembered as I fear what they would do to me if I were to return. I want to live on, but I can’t. Please, if you are part of the team, don’t burn this, my name is not even a name once I am gone, I have no memories to be connected with once you erase me…Please don’t burn my world! Please don’t hurt those as to rid the universe of my existence! Please, I cannot be responsible for the deaths of those I have grown to care for so deeply…for the one who I cannot help but love with a passion so great that I feel like I might burst when I say his name…Zee…Zee…ZEE!

In its obsidian curvature was my own reflection: the horns, the ivory mask, the empty eyes. And I stared, for it was the only thing that I could do. The guiding words boomed from beyond the wall, commanding me to appear, but I could not obey. My reflection refused to step aside and let me pass.',\n",
       " 'A force like a pounding fist reverberated along the barrier, forming a crack that slashed across my reflection’s face. Gray light seeped from the crack, drawn and dispersed into the eddying void. With a shivering crepitation, a second blow fell. The crack widened, making my reflection into a nightmare. At the third blow the barrier could take no more. The crack exploded, and the darkness surged into the luminous rift like water through a burst dam.',\n",
       " 'Taking me with it.',\n",
       " 'I burst forth into an alien world, and the heavy weight of disparity bore down on me. Light and shadow, heat and cold, sensations that I had never known. I collapsed to a floor of white shards that crackled beneath my body. A torrent of black liquid spilled over me and splattered against the floor. I lay there for a time as the liquid drained away, for there was no reason to rise.',\n",
       " 'A being stepped forward into my view. It towered over me, regal and still, like a lighthouse on a cloud-choked night. Draped around its shoulders was a cloak the color of steel that obscured its body and trailed along in its wake. The being wore an ivory mask with two lurking eyes. Atop the mask were seven slender horns resembling a crown. The being tilted its head to regard me and spoke with the very same voice that had shepherded me through the void.',\n",
       " '“Rise, Vessel, so that I might see you.”',\n",
       " 'The order flowed into the empty shells of my limbs, filling them with purpose. They moved of their own volition to lift my body from the ground. The world reoriented, revealing walls, low ceilings, and winding tunnels. Just as the floor had been, these too were composed of crumbling, white shards—but the shards were not featureless. The larger among them displayed horns, eye sockets, and the curves of cheeks. They were masks… just like mine. It was as if my own broken face were staring out at me, a thousand, thousand times.',\n",
       " 'Beside me, wreathed in bramble-black tendrils, sat an orb—an egg. It was huge and impenetrably dark yet possessed of a nacreous luster. I saw myself within it, but the being standing beside me did not cast a reflection. I floated alone in an empty expanse. A jagged wound marred the orb’s otherwise flawless surface. Viscous shadow leaked from it like some vital force. And just as the being had, the orb beckoned. Faintly.',\n",
       " 'The being paced about me, in a slow, methodical ring, noting the curvature of my horns, the slate-gray of my cloak, the darkness of my body. “I behold the apotheosis,” it murmured. “The culmination of all sacrifice. Now until forever, this day shall be known as my Kingdom’s superlative achievement.” The steel of the being’s cloak parted to reveal a carapace of gleaming silver. It reached out an arm to touch me gently on the shoulder. “Come. Hope flutters as a dying Lumafly. The common bugs must see you—my triumph. They must believe in their King once more.”',\n",
       " 'And I followed the being… the King.',\n",
       " 'No other desire presented itself.',\n",
       " 'The endless procession of faces shattered beneath my steps, yet the King’s passage left no trace. He glided effortlessly before me, without a single sound to betray his existence. We emerged into a wider cavern, made chalky and irregular by the masks that formed it. On the far side, near a gaping, black tunnel, stood two more beings, even larger than the King. Both sported armored shells that shared the King’s brilliance. One—the bigger of the two—wielded an enormous mace covered in spikes. The other bore no such weapon, aside from its own hooked claws. Their voices carried through the stagnant air, quiet, but perfectly clear.',\n",
       " '“Our King keeps a rather grim collection, does he not, Hegemol?” the clawed one asked, eyeing the walls. “So many masks, but for what purpose?”',\n",
       " '“Is this your first foray into the pit, Ogrim?” the mace wielder murmured.',\n",
       " '“Yes. I had not been given the—” Ogrim tapped a claw against his chest. “—honor until recently. Does it descend much deeper? I toil to imagine.”',\n",
       " '“That, I do not know,” Hegemol said. He planted his mace on the ground and leaned. “I have never accompanied the King to the bottom. It is his custom to venture forth alone beyond this point. Many long vigils have I endured in anticipation of his returns. I begin to wonder if ‘Mighty’ is not truly my most suitable title. Do you suppose the common bugs would take to calling me ‘Patient Hegemol’ instead?”',\n",
       " '“It bears a pleasing ring Patient Hegemol, but I doubt that the common bugs will ever learn of your long vigils. I knew nothing of this place before joining the Knights. And believe me, I was quite the intrepid adventurer. I believed myself to have turned every stone within this land, but now that I know of this place, I see how closely the King keeps his secrets…”',\n",
       " '“You speak the truth, and I would not have it any other way. Certain things are best never known. The common bugs need not concern themselves with this. They have enough on their minds already with that affliction.”',\n",
       " 'Ogrim grunted. “If that was a joke, it was in poor taste.”',\n",
       " '“Joke? Oh, pardon. That was not my intent.”',\n",
       " 'The pair lapsed into silence, and the King paused mid-step. They did not notice him lingering on the edge of the cavern. I stood behind him and waited. For what, I could not imagine.',\n",
       " '“But still,” Ogrim muttered. “Hours have passed us by. How many more?”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol shrugged. “As many more as the King deems necessary.”',\n",
       " '“But is he truly safe in this place? We have a duty to uphold, after all.”',\n",
       " '“Do not doubt our King. If he were so frail a thing that this place could threaten him, then Hallownest would never have come to be. Our presence here is more for ceremony than protection.”',\n",
       " '“Very well.” Ogrim crossed his claws tightly about himself. “But tell me in earnest, does this seem… wrong to you? The smell. The weight to the air. All these broken masks.”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol pondered. “Not particularly. It isn’t the most festive locale, but there are far more unsightly corners in the Kingdom. I’d take this gloomy hole over a patrol through those stinking fungal tunnels any day.”',\n",
       " '“What is the King’s business here? Has he told you of it?”',\n",
       " '“As He always says, we are here for ‘the good of the Kingdom’. That should be enough for us.”',\n",
       " '“Even so,” Ogrim persisted, “what is the meaning of those ghosts? I have never seen their like in all my travels.”',\n",
       " '“Did I not just say that some things are best never known? Do not trouble yourself with these shadows. They may bite and nibble, but they are no match for a Great Knight. Those claws of yours are not merely for show, as we both know. There is no need to quake.”',\n",
       " '“‘Quake’? Do not turn your jests on me now. I have never quaked in all my years.”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol chuckled, a low, reverberating sound that fought with the oppressive stillness. “Don’t be so quick to bristle, my friend. It is all in mirth, such a thing is needed here.”',\n",
       " '“I suppose.”',\n",
       " '“That being said,” Hegemol continued, “I do seem to recall a few quakes from you at the Battle of the Blackwyrm.”',\n",
       " '“Now wait just a moment! That is hardly fair! Everyone quaked on that day. Even our Pale King.”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol suppressed another chuckle and began to reply, but something stirred in the tunnel beyond.',\n",
       " 'It was a shadow, so much blacker than the surrounding darkness that its outline was visible from a great distance away. It had no wings or means of flight, but it hovered like a storm cloud. As it neared, the shape of a horned head and luminous white eyes became distinguishable, yet its lower body possessed no such structure or symmetry. It dragged a knot of tendrils through the air like unraveling silk.',\n",
       " 'The two Knights readied themselves, brandishing their respective weapons with a flourish. The shadow emerged from the tunnel and drifted forward. It glanced about the room, as if confused. The spotlight of its gaze settled first on Ogrim, then Hegemol, then the King, and finally… me. A whisper pressed against my shell, some plea in a language that I could not understand, and the shadow rushed toward me. It moved between the two Knights, utterly heedless of them, so focused was it on me. But they did not let it pass. The smashing mace and sweeping claws descended, and the dark mass of its body shredded into opaque bubbles that scattered in all directions. It wailed as it flew apart, and the sound echoed on inside my head.',\n",
       " '“You see?” Hegemol laughed. “These little gnats are nothing before a strong arm and a keen weapon!”',\n",
       " '“Well spoken!” Ogrim replied. “It was a mighty blow you delivered! That namesake is well-earned.”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol snorted and hefted his mace over his shoulder. “I would rather you not heap so much praise on me. It is uncouth for a Knight to blush in the heat of battle.”',\n",
       " '“Ha! I’d pay good Geo for such a sight.”',\n",
       " 'The King crossed the room and approached the Knights. For the first time, the masks cracked beneath his feet, announcing his passage. The Knights spun, weapons raised, but as they caught sight of the King, they fell to one knee and spoke in relieved unison. “You have returned, Pale King.”',\n",
       " 'The King lifted an arm, gesturing for the Knights to stand. “Indeed. You are unharmed?”',\n",
       " '“Assuredly,” Ogrim replied. “The Champion’s Call was far more harrowing than this ghastly little romp.”',\n",
       " '“I am relieved,” The King said. He glanced about the room, his expressionless mask taking in the broken collage. “Ghastly…?”',\n",
       " '“I had begun to wonder, your Grace,” Hegemol interjected. “Your previous searches have never taken quite so long. Did this one prove more auspicious?”',\n",
       " 'The King shifted aside like a dramatic curtain, revealing me. His curt command of “Step forth” took possession of my legs and sent me marching forward. The two Knights suddenly noticed me, as if I had manifested from the ether.',\n",
       " 'Hegemol buried the head of his mace into the floor with a wrenching crack and crossed his arms over his chest. He spent a long while in silence, watching me.',\n",
       " 'Ogrim startled. “A child? Down here of all places? My Lord, how did you come across it?” He crouched at my level. “Are you frightened, little one? Hurt? Do not fear. Your King and his Royal Knights are here to protect you. Are you from The City? We could have you home in a matter of hours.”',\n",
       " 'The King did not register the question.',\n",
       " 'And I did not reply.',\n",
       " '“It is larger than the others,” Hegemol observed. “Sturdier. Even from here, I feel it is much more powerful.”',\n",
       " '“What others do you speak of?” Ogrim asked.',\n",
       " 'Hegemol gave a forbidding shake of his head.',\n",
       " '“Again, your keen eyes peer into the truth of things, Hegemol,” The King said. “Before you stands the apex of my labor. The greatest Vessel to yet be conceived. Revel in this moment, for it betokens Hallownest’s most sublime victory.”',\n",
       " '“You have that much faith, my Lord?” Hegemol murmured.',\n",
       " '“Faith? No.” The King strode past the armored bulks of the two Knights and into the far tunnel. “Vision… Now, come. There are many preparations to be made.”',\n",
       " 'We traveled in relative silence, broken only by the snap of the masks underfoot. The tunnels twisted in sinuous patterns, looping over one another and ending without warning. But at no point did the King pause to reconsider his path. He moved with a relentless purpose, ever upward, his pearly bioluminescence dispelling the dark.',\n",
       " 'Eventually, as Hegemol’s breathing grew haggard, we emerged into an immense, rectangular shaft that seemed to stretch endlessly into the shadows overhead. Grooved stone and titanic, fossilized shells made up its walls. At irregular intervals were clusters of spikes, each one nearly as tall as Hegemol. Their reflective, chitinous material made them gleam in the low light.',\n",
       " 'More masks coated the floor, snapping beneath each step.',\n",
       " '“Again, our King guides us infallibly,” Hegemol puffed. “Though we yet have a journey before us.” He looked up at the erratic concretions of stone that jutted from the shaft’s walls. They resembled giant stair steps and served as the only means of ascent. “Quite a journey indeed…”',\n",
       " '“Muster your fortitude, Mighty Hegemol,” the King said. “The time has come to depart this place, but another task yet remains for you.” He reached into the folds of his cloak and drew out a four-pronged sigil of clouded quartz. Light spilled all about it like roiling fog. “As I decree, you shall recruit the aid of Loyal Ogrim and venture east to the lighthouse overlooking the abyssal sea. The light-keeper’s long vigilance is done. Command him to disable the lighthouse and return with you to the White Palace. Nothing of worth yet remains in this festering morass. We shall leave it to its own devices and cast our gaze upon it nevermore. Take this simulacrum of my Brand. Once your task is complete, use it to forever seal the entrance at this shaft’s summit. Ensure that it is done.”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol knelt and lifted an armored palm to receive the sigil. “I understand, my King. Upon my honor, I will not fail.”',\n",
       " 'The King stepped away from us and onto a more level section of the ground. “The Great Knight’s Council shall be held in two days. Dryya, Ze’mer, and Isma shall be returning from their assignments in the other kingdoms. The White Palace’s vestibule shall serve as our place of conclave. I need not remind you to be timely.” He nodded. “Until then.”',\n",
       " '“Pardon, Majesty,” Ogrim blurted. “But what of the child? The trek out of this chasm is arduous even for we Great Knights. Should we send for winged sentries to fly the little one to safety?”',\n",
       " '“You do this little one a disservice, Loyal Ogrim,” the King said. “Let not its meager appearance delude your senses. It is far more capable than you comprehend.” The King turned to me and locked eyes. He pointed to the shaft’s apex, at a far-off speck that appeared to be a metal balcony. “Observe and follow,” he commanded.',\n",
       " 'The King flared his cloak about himself with a flick of his arms, and a corona of light encircled him. Overlapping steel gave way to translucent white, and in an instant the King’s cloak had transformed into a pair of wings. Shed feathers twinkled like constellations before fading into nothing. The King tensed his wings in preparation for flight, but an object—small and bug-like— plummeted from on high.',\n",
       " 'The object crashed into a nearby heap of masks, launching fragments all about. Hegemol lunged forward, planting himself before the King and making a shield of his own body. The mask-shrapnel bounced harmlessly off his carapace and clattered to the ground. A cloud of gray dust hung in the air, obscuring the fallen object.',\n",
       " '“Another foe?!” Ogrim shouted, charging over to stand beside Hegemol.',\n",
       " '“Steady yourselves, Knights,” the King said. “That thing is no threat; no consequence to you. It is mere refuse being disposed of. Banish it from your thoughts and remain sworn to your charge. We shall speak again soon.”',\n",
       " 'The King stretched his incandescent wings and flapped, with enough force to scatter the cloud of dust and send himself soaring into the air. He climbed without looking back, not even pausing to rest upon the stone slabs protruding from the walls. I watched him with unwavering intent, absorbing every movement of his body and slant to his wings. I could not wrench my gaze from him, nor did I wish to.',\n",
       " 'As the cloud of dust dissipated, Ogrim took a hissing breath and slid back a step. His attention was not drawn to the King, but to the fallen object in the corner of my vision.',\n",
       " 'It was a bug corpse.',\n",
       " 'One that resembled me in every way.',\n",
       " 'It too was a creature of white horns and black eyes, with a slate-gray cloak that concealed the darkness of its body. But there were minor differences. It was half-again smaller than me, and possessed four, diminutive horns that curled down to frame its face.',\n",
       " '“What is the meaning of this?” Ogrim whispered. He looked from the corpse to the masks to me in quick succession.',\n",
       " 'Hegemol clapped a claw on Ogrim’s shoulder and nodded eastward. “You heard the King’s decree. That thing before you is of no concern. Come. We mustn’t tarry.”',\n",
       " 'Ogrim tore his shoulder free of the grasp. “No concern? In what way is this of no concern? Does that not resemble a citizen of our Kingdom stone-dead upon the ground?”',\n",
       " '“Heed my advice. If the King sees fit to enlighten you, then he will. But for now, it is not your responsibility. Accompany me as you were instructed.”',\n",
       " 'Ogrim knelt and lifted the still form in his arms. Its head lolled at a grotesque angle, revealing several cracks that ran the length of its mask. “It is a child, Hegemol! If this is not my responsibility as a Knight, then nothing is!”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol let out a growling sigh. “The King commanded us to—”',\n",
       " '“How is this child mere refuse? Why was it being disposed of?”',\n",
       " '“Do not allow yourself to be distracted!” Hegemol shouted. “We have a duty to uphold. Now rise, this is unbecoming of a Knight.”',\n",
       " '“Duty? Is not my duty to the bugs of this land? Is it not unbecoming of a Knight to disregard the death of an innocent before his very eyes?” Ogrim lifted his head and looked about, as if seeing for the very first time. “What is this place, Hegemol? A mass grave?”',\n",
       " 'Hegemol clamped Ogrim beneath the arm and tossed him to his feet. Their faces hovered an inch apart. “That. Is not. A child. This. Is not. A grave.” He swatted the corpse from Ogrim’s arms, and it crashed into a nearby heap of masks. The outline of its body wavered and frothed, like water just beginning to boil. Black bubbles separated from it and floated away on an imaginary breeze. “You are Loyal Ogrim of the Five Great Knights!” Hegemol snarled. “You have been granted a task by your King, your Sovereign, your Lord. Will you see it done, or will you forsake your purpose while fretting over a broken tool?”',\n",
       " 'Ogrim’s body trembled. He looked to me again, but I did not meet his gaze, my focus was elsewhere.',\n",
       " '“Well, what say you?!” Hegemol slammed his palms against Ogrim’s chest.',\n",
       " 'The King ended his flight at the summit of the shaft. His wings crumbled out of existence, replaced once again by the steel cloak. He tightened it around himself and resumed his austere pose. Even from that vast distance, I felt when he turned to look down upon me. His will echoed on and took hold of my body yet again.',\n",
       " '\\nFollow.\\n',\n",
       " 'I responded, the marionette. My legs bent, my cloak fluttered, and a power that I did not know I possessed surged up within me. I jumped, straight up, and as I did, the substance of my cloak transmuted into a pair of ephemeral wings, shorter than the King’s but nearly as bright. They flapped, launching me clumsily into the air. I landed on the stone slabs, one after the other, planting my feet, bracing my body, and leaping up for another brief flight. Over and over, in mechanical repetition. And as I went, my movements grew smoother, more elegant, closer and closer to the King’s.',\n",
       " 'I did not look back, toward Ogrim or Hegemol. I did not hear the last dregs of their debate, or Ogrim’s reply. Every ounce of me was invested in the climb. Exertion burned in my limbs, but I did not slow. I could not. The King was watching, urging me ever upward.',\n",
       " '\\nNo cost too great.\\n',\n",
       " 'The words boomed inside my head as I glided from one platform to another.',\n",
       " '\\nTen thousand failures have preceded you. And should you fall, then ten thousand more shall follow.\\n',\n",
       " 'I kicked off a wall and soared over a cluster of chitinous spikes.',\n",
       " '\\nNo mind to think. For to possess a mind is to possess a vulnerability. So easily subverted. So easily controlled.\\n',\n",
       " 'I grabbed a ledge and hauled myself to my feet.',\n",
       " '\\nNo will to break. For time degrades all intent. Purpose, no matter how unflinching, is nothing before those ceaseless waves. Will is not enough. It must be discarded.\\n',\n",
       " 'One of my wings clipped the edge of a spike, shedding ghostly feathers.',\n",
       " '\\nNo voice to cry suffering. Toil is the lot of the living. To live eternal is to toil eternal. If suffering is foregone, then it need not be heralded.\\n',\n",
       " 'I redoubled my efforts, one wing flapping harder than the other.',\n",
       " '\\nBorn of God and Void. No tool of inferior element shall suffice. Only the perfect may achieve the impossible.\\n',\n",
       " 'The balcony upon which the King stood grew closer with every strain of my legs and every thrash of my wings.',\n",
       " '\\nYou shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams. The Kingdom cannot coexist with such uniformity. It inhibits potential. It murders the ideal. It sees nothing beyond propagation.\\n',\n",
       " 'With one final lunge, I crested the balcony and landed before the King. My body lurched from exhaustion, but I kept my feet. The King watched me—with approval or otherwise, it could not be known. After a time, he spoke, and the echo left my head.',\n",
       " '“You are the Vessel. None other shall rival your merit.',\n",
       " 'You are the Hollow Knight… You are my child…”',\n",
       " 'My wings shriveled, curling up like a dying bug. They reverted to a cloak and hung limply about me as I heaved. My body felt tenuous—insubstantial—as if I would deliquesce and drain through the grating of the balcony.',\n",
       " 'The King paused, until my breathing returned to normal and I stood straight. “Many trials await you,” he said, “each one more brutal and unrelenting than the last. Should you prove… deficient, then this same end shall be yours.”',\n",
       " 'With a slight turn of his head, the King signaled to someone behind him. The balcony ended in an archway that led into a tunnel, and within I saw several more beings, more bugs. They were silver from head to foot, with oval-shaped carapaces, short limbs, and vestigial wings that hung down their backs. They stood at attention beside a large metal cart, completely silent. The King’s signal set them all into motion. They hauled the cart to the edge of the balcony and removed the silken tarp that covered it, revealing a pile of corpses. All of which resembled me. Just as the other corpse had. Horns. White masks. Dark eyes. Cloaks.',\n",
       " 'The King nodded again, and the silver bugs set to work dragging the bodies out of the cart and hurling them over the side. They plummeted like stones, striking against the walls and floors of the shaft, shattering into a thousand pieces. White shards and horn fragments sprinkled down the dizzying drop and rattled to a halt at the bottom.',\n",
       " 'Hegemol and Ogrim were nowhere to be seen.',\n",
       " 'The King crossed his arms beneath his cloak and watched. He noted the mask of each and every corpse before it was pitched, halting a silver bug periodically in order to see more closely. He did not speak. Even after the last body had been disposed of.',\n",
       " 'The silver bugs retreated once the cart was empty. They hustled quietly down the tunnel and around a corner, leaving the King and I alone.',\n",
       " '“But… you shall not prove… deficient,” the King finally said. “A different destiny hangs over you. My prescience allows me that much. Do not fear, I shall ensure—” But he stopped, checked himself with a deprecating chuckle, and shook his head. “Come.”',\n",
       " 'The King turned and left the shaft. He waved a claw in front of a huge, carved tablet beside the archway. Runes of white light blazed into existence against its dusky surface. They twisted, fading in and out, as if being rewritten. After a moment, the King slipped his arm back into the folds of his cloak and marched down the tunnel.',\n",
       " 'My feet drew me forward, with the same inevitable compulsion. But I heard a sound behind me: the scratch of limbs finding purchase upon the balcony’s edge. And with that sound, a faint reverberation in my head like a voice asking a question.',\n",
       " 'I halted and glanced over my shoulder to behold another being. Like me, but diminutive, with underdeveloped horns and a tattered cloak. It looked at me, with wide, black eyes as it clutched against the pull of gravity.',\n",
       " '…Did it desire something of me? Was it doomed to corpsehood like all the others? And was that… somehow my fault?',\n",
       " 'At the bend in the tunnel, the King stopped. “Come,” he repeated, impatience creeping along the word’s edge.',\n",
       " 'My purpose returned to me, and I strode down the tunnel after the King. The rasp of a failing grip and the flutter of a cloak in free fall echoed after me. And with it, a wail, haunting and silent.',\n",
